Chapter 1

What are numbers?
Numbers exist to count things.
In the beginning we count things starting from 1
eventually it was discovered that 0 exists


Adding Numbers = moving along the right line
Subtracting numbers = moving along the left line

Inverse numbers are the oppposite number from their line
They cancel each other out
