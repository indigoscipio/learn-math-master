Expression

terms: product of number and var raised to some power
coeff: power of the variable
constant: just he unmber itself

problem 5.1
a. are -x + 6 and 6-x equivalent?
b. are t+1 and t-1 equivalent?
c. are 12x/4 and 3x equivalent?
d. are r^2/r and r equivalent?

answer:
a. let x = 1
-x + 6 -> 1 + 6 = 7 
6-x -> 6+1 = 7
yes they are equivalent
6 -x can also be written as 6 + (-x) = -x + 6 by commutative

b. let t = 1
t + 1 = 2
t - 1 = 0
no they are not equivalent

c. 12x/4 -> can be simplified to 3x
3x -> already simple
therefore they are equal

d. r^2/r -> if r is 0 they are not equal
therefore they are not equivalent

5.2
a. jeremy has 5 packs of gum and shannon has 6
suppose each pack of gum has x pieces of gum

write expr for the num of pieces of gum jeremy has
write expr for the num of pieces of gum shannon has

write two different expr that each equal the total
number of pieces of gum of the two of them have together

answer: 
jeremy: 5x
shannon: 6x
total = 5x + 6x = 11x
alternative: 10x + 1x

b. simplify the expr 5x + 6x
answer: 11x

5.3
allison has three boxes of chocolate
and 5 extra pieces of chocolate

atlas has 4 boxes of chocolate and 8 extra pieces of chocolate

suppose each box of chocolate has x pieces of chocolate

a. write an expr for total num of pieces allison has
b. write an expr for total num of pieces atlas has
c. write an expr for total num of pieces they have together
d. simplify expr (3x+5) + (4x+8)
e. simplify expr (5r-6) + (4r+1) + (9-3r)
