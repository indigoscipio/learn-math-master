problem 5.1
a. are -x + 6 and 6-x equivalent?
b. are t+1 and t-1 equivalent?
c. are 12x/4 and 3x equivalent?
d. are r^2/r and r equivalent?

answer:
a. let x = 1
-x + 6 -> 1 + 6 = 7 
6-x -> 6+1 = 7
yes they are equivalent
6 -x can also be written as 6 + (-x) = -x + 6 by commutative

b. let t = 1
t + 1 = 2
t - 1 = 0
no they are not equivalent

c. 12x/4 -> can be simplified to 3x
3x -> already simple
therefore they are equal

d. r^2/r -> if r is 0 they are not equal
therefore they are not equivalent

a. jeremy has 5 packs of gum and shannon has 6
suppose each pack of gum has x pieces of gum

write expr for the num of pieces of gum jeremy has
write expr for the num of pieces of gum shannon has

write two different expr that each equal the total

exercise
5.1.1
simplify each of the folowing
a. 2r + 3r - 7r
= 5r - 7r = -2r

b. -y

c. 4t+2

d. -2z -1/2

e. -3x+2x+6x/6
= -5x/6

f. 12 - 5r/2 - 7r/3
= 12 -15r-14r /6
= 12 -29r/6

5.1.2
simplif each
a. 7(x-2) + 5(2x+3)
= 7x-14 + 10x+15
= 7x+10x -14+15
= 17x+1

b. 4(3a-4) - 6(2a-1)
= 12a-16 -12a + 6
= -16+6 = -10

c. -3(1 + 3t) - (t+3) (1+4)
= -3-9t -(t+3) 5
= -3-9t (-t-3) 5
= -3-9t -5t-15
= -3-15 -9t-5t
= -18 -14t

d. -5(22 - 31y) + 22(4y + 3)
= -110 + 155y + 88y+66
= -110+66+155y+88y
= -44+243y

5.1.3
simplify each of the following
a. 12-4c/4 + 27+18c/3
3-c + 9+6c = 12+5c

b. 1/2(6-4y) + 3/2(6y+4)
1st part
= 1/2 . 6 - 1/2 . 4y
= 3 - 2y

2nd part 
= 3/2 . 6y + 3/2 . 4
= 9y + 6

sum  = 3 - 2y + 9y + 6 = 7y + 9

c. 3r+7 - (24-16r)/8

= 24/8 - 16r/8 = 4 -2r

3r+7 -(3-2r)
= 3r+7 -3+2r
= 3r+2r+7-3
= 5r+4

d. (x-7)/3 - (5-x)/2
denumerator = 6

2x-14 - (15-3x)/6

5.1.4
are the expressions (2/x)/4 and 2/(x/4) equivalent:
answer:

(2/x)/4 can be written as:
2/x : 4 = 2/x * 1/4 = 2/4x = 1/2x

2/(x/4) can be written as
2 : x/4 = 2 * 4/x = 8/x

therefore the two expresions are not equal

5.1.5
the expr 3x + 4x can be simplified to 7x
can the expr 3x + 4y be simplifyed simialrly?

answer:
since 3x + 4x have the same terms it can use the distribution method
however x and y is two different term and cannot be simplified further

5.1.6
the expression x + x can be simplified to 2x.
a. can the expression x^2 + x^2 be simplified similarly?
answer:
small example
let x = 2
x^2 + x^2 = 4 + 4 = 8

if we use the same method then it would be 2 x^2 = 2 . 4 = 8

yes since it has the same term whch is x^2

b. can the expressoin x^2 + x be simplified similarly?
answer: no we cannot since the term is 

x . 1 + x . x = x (x + 1)

Linear equations

5.8
consider the equation x - 12 = 289 . we sill solve this equation in several diferent ways

a. use your undertanding of numbers to find a value of x that makes the equation true
b. what number can be added to both sides of equation to give an equation
which x is alone on the left side?
c. use part b to solve the equation

a. 301 - 12 = 289
b. add + 12 to both sides
c. x - 12 + 12 = 289 + 12
x = 301

5.9
solve the following equations
a. x - 4 2/3 = 2 4/5
b. 4 - 5 1/5 = 2x + 3 - x + 3 1/5

answer:
a. x - 14/3 = 14/5
add both sides 14/3
x - 14/3 + 14/3 = 14/5 + 14/3
x = 42+70/15
x = 112/15

b. 4 - 5 1/5 = 2x + 3 - x + 3 1/5
rhs
2x + 3 - x + 3 1/5
= x + 3 + 3 1/5
= x + 3 + 16/5
= x + 31/5

4 - 5 1/5 = x + 31/5
subtract both sides by 31/5
4 - 5 1/5 - 31/5 = x
4 - 26/5 - 31/5 = x
4 -26-31/5 = x
= 4 - 57/5 = x
20-57/5 = x
-37/5 = x

= 7 9/10

d. -2y + 2 3/5 + 3y = 1 7/10
y = 1 7/10 - 2 3/5
y = 1-2 + 7/10-3/5
