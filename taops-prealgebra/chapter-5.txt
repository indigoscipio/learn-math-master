problem 5.1
a. are -x + 6 and 6-x equivalent?
b. are t+1 and t-1 equivalent?
c. are 12x/4 and 3x equivalent?
d. are r^2/r and r equivalent?

answer:
a. let x = 1
-x + 6 -> 1 + 6 = 7 
6-x -> 6+1 = 7
yes they are equivalent
6 -x can also be written as 6 + (-x) = -x + 6 by commutative

b. let t = 1
t + 1 = 2
t - 1 = 0
no they are not equivalent

c. 12x/4 -> can be simplified to 3x
3x -> already simple
therefore they are equal

d. r^2/r -> if r is 0 they are not equal
therefore they are not equivalent

= 5r - 7r = -2r

b. -y

c. 4t+2

d. -2z -1/2

e. -3x+2x+6x/6
= -5x/6

f. 12 - 5r/2 - 7r/3
= 12 -15r-14r /6
= 12 -29r/6

5.1.2
simplif each
a. 7(x-2) + 5(2x+3)
= 7x-14 + 10x+15
= 7x+10x -14+15
= 17x+1

b. 4(3a-4) - 6(2a-1)
= 12a-16 -12a + 6
= -16+6 = -10

c. -3(1 + 3t) - (t+3) (1+4)
= -3-9t -(t+3) 5
= -3-9t (-t-3) 5
= -3-9t -5t-15
= -3-15 -9t-5t
= -18 -14t

d. -5(22 - 31y) + 22(4y + 3)
= -110 + 155y + 88y+66
= -110+66+155y+88y
= -44+243y

5.1.3
simplify each of the following
a. 12-4c/4 + 27+18c/3
3-c + 9+6c = 12+5c

b. 1/2(6-4y) + 3/2(6y+4)
1st part
= 1/2 . 6 - 1/2 . 4y
= 3 - 2y

2nd part

5.1.4
are the expressions (2/x)/4 and 2/(x/4) equivalent:
answer:

(2/x)/4 can be written as:
2/x : 4 = 2/x * 1/4 = 2/4x = 1/2x

2/(x/4) can be written as
2 : x/4 = 2 * 4/x = 8/x

therefore the two expresions are not equal

5.1.5
the expr 3x + 4x can be simplified to 7x
can the expr 3x + 4y be simplifyed simialrly?

answer:
since 3x + 4x have the same terms it can use the distribution method
however x and y is two different term and cannot be simplified further

5.1.6
the expression x + x can be simplified to 2x.
a. can the expression x^2 + x^2 be simplified similarly?
answer:
small example
let x = 2
x^2 + x^2 = 4 + 4 = 8

if we use the same method then it would be 2 x^2 = 2 . 4 = 8

yes since it has the same term whch is x^2

b. can the expressoin x^2 + x be simplified similarly?
answer: no we cannot since the term is 

x . 1 + x . x = x (x + 1)

Linear equations

5.8
consider the equation x - 12 = 289 . we sill solve this equation in several diferent ways

a. use your undertanding of numbers to find a value of x that makes the equation true
b. what number can be added to both sides of equation to give an equation
which x is alone on the left side?
c. use part b to solve the equation

a. 301 - 12 = 289
b. add + 12 to both sides
c. x - 12 + 12 = 289 + 12
x = 301

5.9
solve the following equations
a. x - 4 2/3 = 2 4/5
b. 4 - 5 1/5 = 2x + 3 - x + 3 1/5

answer:
a. x - 14/3 = 14/5
add both sides 14/3
x - 14/3 + 14/3 = 14/5 + 14/3
x = 42+70/15
x = 112/15

b. 4 - 5 1/5 = 2x + 3 - x + 3 1/5
rhs
2x + 3 - x + 3 1/5
= x + 3 + 3 1/5
= x + 3 + 16/5
= x + 31/5

4 - 5 1/5 = x + 31/5
subtract both sides by 31/5
4 - 5 1/5 - 31/5 = x
4 - 26/5 - 31/5 = x
4 -26-31/5 = x
= 4 - 57/5 = x
20-57/5 = x
-37/5 = x

when you add 12 to a number and then divide the sum by 13
you get the same result as when you subtract 13 from the number and then
divide the difference by 12

what is the number?
answer:
add 12 to a number and then divide the sum by 13 ->
(n + 12 )/ 13

subtract 13 from the number and then divide the difference by 12
(n - 13) / 12

so we have (n+12)/13 = (n-13)/ 12
lcm of 12,13 = 156

156.(n+12)/13 = 156.(n-13)/12
12n+144 = 13n-169
12n-13n = -169-144

i bought a new comic book at the ocmic book shop and paidi entirely using quarter
if i had paid using dimesi would have nede 9 more coins
how much did the ocmic book cost?

dime = 10c = $0.10
quarter = 25c = $0.25

answer:
so that means its a multiple of 25c

if paid using dimes -> needs 9 more coins (90c remainder)
wait that doesn't make any sense
25q = 10q + 90
25q-10q = 90
15q = 90
q = 90/15
q = 6
