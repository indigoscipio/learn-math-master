when you add 12 to a number and then divide the sum by 13
you get the same result as when you subtract 13 from the number and then
divide the difference by 12

what is the number?
answer:
add 12 to a number and then divide the sum by 13 ->
(n + 12 )/ 13

subtract 13 from the number and then divide the difference by 12
(n - 13) / 12

so we have (n+12)/13 = (n-13)/ 12
lcm of 12,13 = 156

156.(n+12)/13 = 156.(n-13)/12
12n+144 = 13n-169
12n-13n = -169-144

i bought a new comic book at the ocmic book shop and paidi entirely using quarter
if i had paid using dimesi would have nede 9 more coins
how much did the ocmic book cost?

dime = 10c = $0.10
quarter = 25c = $0.25

answer:
so that means its a multiple of 25c

if paid using dimes -> needs 9 more coins (90c remainder)
wait that doesn't make any sense
25q = 10q + 90
25q-10q = 90

36 = 9n
n = 4

the sum of the ages of 3 children is 32
the age of the oldest is twice the age of the yougnest
the 2 odler children differ by three years
what is the age of the yougnest child

answer:
sum of ages = children a age + children b age + children c age
32 = a + b + c

how dhould i define the corect variable
need to find the 2 oldest then we can find the youngest age

lets try
let y represent the age of the youngest child
we know the first oldest = 2y
so the other oldest must be = 2y-3

so if we subtitute
y + 2y + 2y-3 = 32
5y - 3  = 32
5y = 35
y = 7

if the sum of six consecutive even integers is 282
what is the largest of the integer

answer:
we can represent six consecutive even integer as
(n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) + (n+10) + (n+12) = 282
6n + (2+4+6+8+10+12) = 282
6n + 42 = 282
6n = 240
n = 40

the largest would be n + 12
so 40 + 12 = 52

bobbys bike shack orders tires each week for its two wheel bikes and three wheel bikes
they order tires for all 47 of their bikes this week
if they ordered 112 tires how many two wheel bikes does the bike shack have

answer:
ok so the bike shack has 2 type of bikes
2 wheel and 3 wheel bikes

they have a total of 47 bikes of those types
we dont know which one is which

and they ordered 112 tires
we need to find how many 2w bikes they have

so lets start with assuming if those 47 bikes are two wheels
if that is the case then 47 * 2 = 94 bikes

and the difference total = 112 - 94 = 18 short tires

now if we change 1 2w bike into 3w bike that would convert into 1 addiitonal tire surplus
so 46 * 2 = 92
1 * 3 = 3
now the total is 95

so in order to balance each other out we'd need to subtract 18 2w
and add 18 3w
so 29 * 2 = 58
18 * 3 = 54
which leave us with 112 total tires and 47 bike counts

alternatively
let t = no of 2 wheel bikes
three wheel bikes = 47 - t

t + 47 - t = 112

in problem 5.22 we solved thi sproblem
i bought a new comic book at the ocmic book shop and paidi entirely using quarter
if i had paid using dimesi would have nede 9 more coins
how much did the ocmic book cost?

we first considered assign a variable to the cost of the ocmic book but instead found a solution by assigning
a variable to the number of quarter i used to buy the comic book
however it is possible to find the oslution by asigning a variable to th ecost of the comic book
how?

hint: if c is the cost of the comic book in cents then what
other quantities in the problem can you express in terms of c?

answer:

in the old answer
dime = 10c = $0.10
quarter = 25c = $0.25
so that means its a multiple of 25c
if paid using dimes -> needs 9 more coins (90c remainder)
wait that doesn't make any sense
25q = 1(q+9)
25q = 10q + 90
25q-10q = 90
15q = 90
q = 90/15
q = 6

now we need to redefine variable by assining variable to the cost of the book

c/10 = c/25 + 9
5c = 2c + 450
3c = 450
c = 450/3
c = 150

a. manute is tlaler than michael. michael is taller than mugsy. is manute taller than mugsy?
b. if a > b and b > c then is a > c ?
c. if a > b and b < c, then do we know which of a or c is larger?

answer:
a. let manute = a, michael = b, and mugsy = c
we know maunte is taller than michael, we can represent this as
a > b
and we know michael is taller than mugsy, so
b > c

since a > b and b > c, it a must be bigger than c
threfore manute is taller than mugsy

b. let a = 3, b = 2, c = 1
so 3 > 2
and 2  > 1
therefore 3 > 1 is true

c. let a = 3, b = 1, c = 2
so 3 > 2
if b is smaller than c, then 1 < 2
so the larger integer is a

but if we let c = 5
then it be comes 3 < 5
and 1 < 5
so in this case the larger integer is c

since both situation are possible we can't say for certain which is larger

a. bill gates has more money than warren buffet
if they each win a 100mil dollar lottery
then will bill gates still have more money than warren buffet??
what if they each give 100 million dollars to the art of problem solving foundation?
then whi will have more money?

answer:
let x represents the amount of money bill gates has
and y represents the amount of money warren buffet has

then we know:
x > y -> each give 100m
x - 100 > y - 100
yes because x is more than y by offseting them by the same number both wont change the inequality
if they both give 100m to aops its still the same - bill gates still have more money

b. suppose x > y. explain why x + 5 > y + 5 and x - 5 > y - 5
answer:
we can subtract 5 from both to get
x > y - x is still bigger than y
and in the 2nd case ad both by 5 to isolate x and y, x is still bigger than y

c. suppose x > y and a > b. explain why x + a > y + b
answer:
let x = 2, y = 1
let a = 2, b = 1

2 + 2 > 1 + 1
4 > 2
which is true

generalization
since x and a is in the "bigger end" and y and b is on the "smaller" end on both equation,
adding two maximum/"bigger" numbers will result in an equality that's always larger than the two "smaller" ones

d. note that 7 > 5 and 3 > 2, and that  7 + 2 > 5 + 3
is it always true that if x > y and a > b, then x + b > y + a?

answer: find ocunterexample
let x = 2
a = 3
y = 1
b = 1

x + b > y + a
2 + 1 > 1 + 3
3 > 4 false
so its not the case

in this problem we investigate what happens when we multiply both sides of an inequality by a positve number.
suppose x > y
a. must we always have 3x > 3y?
b. must we laways have 2/3x > 2/3y?
c. must we always have ax > ay for any positive number a?

answer:
a. if we divide both side by 3, then we have
x > y, so the equation is strue but the end value depends on x and y each
b. if we multiply both sides by 3/2, we have x > y and the final value depends on x and y since its still positive
c. we can multiple both sides by the reciprocal of a to get x > y
as long as a is positive

5.29
in this problem we investigate what hapens when multipyboth sides by negative
suppose x > y
a. which is greater, -2x or -2y?
b. if b < 0, then which is greater, bx or by?

answer:
a. since we know x > y
the negation of x (the greater side) is now the smallest one
so -2x < -2y
b. if b is negative then since we know x > y,
then the x is the smallest one by multipling with negative
so the greater is now by

in each folowing part describe values of variable that make the equality true
a. -2 < r <=4
b. 2x + 7 < -3
c. 3 (5-2y) >= 2y - 9

answer:
a. r is from -1 to 4: -1,0,1,2,3,4
b. 2x < -3 -7
2x < -10
x < -10/2
x < -5
so x is from -6 to -infinity
c. 15-6y >= 2y-9
-6y-2y >= -9-15
-8y >= -24
y <= -24/-8
y <= 3
so y is from 3 to - infinity

my town has two cell phone providers
donttalkmuch charges $80 per month plus 1 dollar per hour
talklots charges $20 per month plus 4 dollar per hour
how much do you have to use phone in a month in order for donttalkmuch deal to be better to you

let cost per hour = y
donttalkmuch = 80 + 1y
talklots = 20 + 4y

since we want to find better this means smaller euqality
80 + 1y < 20 + 4y
80 - 20 < 4y-1y
60 < 3y
60/3 < y
20 < y
y > 20

therefore we want to use more than 20 hours

i have 308 baseball cards
tommy has 532 baseball cards
starting tomororw tommy will give each of his four closest friends, including me
one baseball cards each from his collection everyday
how many cards will i have on the first day that i have more cards that tommy has?

asnwer:
start simple -
day 1 = 532 - 4
day 2 = 532 - 2 . 4
day 3 = 532 = 3 . 4 ...

let d represent the amount of days that passed
308 + d > 532 - 4d
308 - 532 > -4d - d
-224 > -5d
224 < 5d
224/5 < d
44 4/5 < d
d > 44 4/5

therefore d must be greather than 44 4/5 days
so 45
