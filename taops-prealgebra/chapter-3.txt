=====================================

Multiples
let A and B be numbers. we say that a is a multiple of b
if a = b . k where k is some integer
a is a multiple of b if there is an intege n such that a = bn

problem 3.1
a. both 147 and 357 are multiples of 7. is 147 + 357 a multiple of 7?
answer:
yes because 504 = 7 . n where n is 72

b. suppose k is a multiple of 7. must k + 7 be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 7 = 14 -> 14 is a multiple of 7 . n where n = 2 so 14 = 7 . 2 therfoer muliple of 7 

because k is a multiple of 7, there is an integer a such that k = 7a
adding 7 to k gives k + 7 = 7a + 7
k + 7 = 7(a + 1)
let b = a + 1.
k + 7 = 7b
since b is an integer, therefore k+7 is a multiple of 7

c. suppose r and s are multiples of 7. must r + s be a multiple of 7?
r = 7m
n = 7n
r + s = 7m + 7n
= 7(m+n)
since m+n is an integer, threfore 7(m+n) is also an integer
by definition of multiples, m+n is a multiple of 7

d. suppose k is a multiple of 7. is it possible for k+23 to be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 23 = 30 -> 30 is not a multiple of 7 since the reminder is not 0
therefore k+23 is not a multiple of 7

problem 3.2
what number between 100 and 200 is both a perfect square and a multiple of 7?
14*14 = 196
196 is a mulitple of 7 since 196 = 7 . 28
and a perfect square of 7 since 7^2 = 196

196 = 14 . 14 = 14 . 2 .7 = 28 . 7

problem 3.3
what is the greatest three digit number that is a multiple of 13?
answer:
start with 999 and check one by one
when dividing 999 / 13 we get quotient of 76 and reminder 11
988 = 76 . 13 -> therefore 988 is the answer

Problem 3.4
a. how many integers between 2 and 1004 are multiples of 5
b. how many integers between 150 and 300 are multiples of 9

a. lets tart with
1004 - 2 = 1002
5,10,15,...,1000
5(1,2,3,...,200)
therefore 200 multples of 5

b. 
multiples of 9 less than 300
9,18,27,...,297
= 9(1,2,...,33)

multiples of 9 less than 150
= 9(1,2,...,16)

therefore final result = 33 - 16 = 17

problem 3.5
a. must every multiple of 15 also be a multiple of 3?
answer: yes, because 15 has a common factor of 3 / divisible by 3
eg 30 = 3 . 10, 45 = 3 . 15, etc

b. must every multple of 3 also be a multiple of 15?
answer: no, counterexample:
6 is not a multipel of 15 because 6 is not divisble by 15

==============================================

if a and b are multiples of c
then a + b and a - c are also multiple of c

if we start with a multiple of n and add/subract a number
that is not a multiple of n, the nthe resulting sum/diff
is not a multple of n

if a is a multiple of b, then eevery multiple of a is also a multiple of b
transitivity of divisibility

exercises
3.1.1
what are the 10 smallest positive multiplesof 6?
answer:
6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,44,60

3.1.2
there are many positive two digit multiples of 7
but only two of these multiples have a digit sum  of 10
the digit sum of an integer is the sum of its digits.
what are these two multiples of 7?
answer
ok, so we ned to find two digit multiple of 7 that when summed the result is 10
28 and 91


3.1.3
what is the sum of all positive integer less than 100 that are multipeles of 13?
answer:
largest multiple of 13 less than 100 = 91 = 13 . 7
13(1+2+3+...+7)
= 13(28)
= 364

3.1.4
what is the least positive number that can be added to 173 so that
the result is a multiple of 20?
answer: we know 160 is the smaller multple 20 > 173
so 180 must be the largest
180 - 173 = 7 therefore 7

3.1.5
what is the smallest positive four digit multiple of 17?
1700 = 17 . 100
170 = 17 . 10
340 = 17 . 20
680 = 17 . 40

1700 - 680 = 1020
1020 - 17 = 1003

alternatively
1000 / 17 = 

3.1.6
what is the greatest four digit multiple of 18?
answer:
biggest four digit multiple of 18
18* 500 = 9000
18 * 25 = 450
18 * 25 = 450
18 * 5 = 90


18 * 500 + 18 * 25 + 18 * 25 + 18 * 5
= 9000 + 900 + 90
= 9990 

3.1.7
what is the greatest three digit multiple of 33
that can be written using three different digits?

answer:
ok so we know 990 is a multiple of 33 and the largest
but its digits are the same
next smallest = 990 - 33 = 957 -> different, therefore this is the largest


3.1.8
how many integers between 17 and 2678 are multiples of 11?
answer:
2 * 11 = 22 so this is the starting point 17 < n < 2678
we know 2678 / 11 is around 243 with some reminer, so 243 is the upper limit
so its 22, 33, 44 ... 2678 = 11(2,3,...,243)
now for the count: 243 - 2 + 1
= 242

===============

Divisibility tests

a is divisibile by b is a / b is an integer

problems
problem 3.6
a. note that
121212 = 120000 + 1200 + 12
how can we use this fact to tell that 121212 is divisible by 3?
answer:
RHS
= 3(40000) + 3(400) + 3(4)
= 3(40000+400+4) = 3(40404)
since 40404 is an integer, therefore its multiple/divisible by 3

b. how can we quickly tell  that 363637 is not divisible by 3?
answer:
363637 = 360000 + 3600 + 36 + 1
= 3(120000) + 3(1200) + 3(12) + 1
= 3(121212) + 1
since we have a reminder of 1 its not divisible by 3

problem 3.7
how can we tell at a glance a number is not a multiple of 10?
answer:
if the number is not divisble by 10, then the number i not a multiple of 10
or if the number leaves a reminder when dividing by 10
eg 13 / 10 = 1 with 3 reminder, therefore not divisble by 10

or generally, A number is not a multiple of 10 if
its last digit is any number other than 0.

problem 3.8
a. is every multiple of 10 is also a multiple of 5?
answer: 
10 = 5(2)
20 = 5(4)
how to prove generally?

a number is a multiple of 10 we can express as a = 10k where k is some integer
we want to shot if we can rewrite

a = 5 x (some integer)
since a = 10k, we can factor this into a = 5(2k)
since 2k is an integer, a is also an integer therefore
a is written as 5 times an integer. meaning a must be a multiple of 5


b. how can we tell at a glance wheter or not a number is a multiple of 5?
answer:

10 = 5 . 2
50 = 5 . 10
25 = 5 . 5
35 = 5 . 7
based on the pattern
we know that a number is a multiple of 5 if
the last digit ends with 5, or
the last digit ends with 0 (since number divisible by 10 also divisible by 5)


c. how can we tell at a glance wheter or not a number is a multiple of 2?
answer:
2 = 1 . 2
4 = 2 . 2
6 = 3 . 2

we know a number is a multiple of 2
if that number is even (2k) / divisibel by 2
and if the last digit is even (0,2,4,6,8)

problem 3.9
a. which of the following numbers are divisble by 4
12, 312, 512, 1512, 4312
answer: all of them are divisible by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number
formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

b. is every multiple of 100 also a multiple of 4?
answer:

100 = 4 (25)
200 = 8 (25) = 2 (4 . 25)
300 = 12 (25) = 3 (4 . 25)

yes because 100 = 25 . 4 which has 4 as a factor
general proof

a = 100k -> number is multiple of 100
we need to show if a can be written as a = 4 . some integer
a = 4 (25k)
therefore divisble by 4

c. use your answer to part b to expalin why 5,687,623,688 is divisible by 4
we need to show 5,687,623,688 = 4 . some integer

= 5,687,623,600 + 88
= 100 (56876236)
= 4 . 25 . 56876236 + 88
= 4 (25 . 56876236) + 4 (22)
= 4 ((25.56876236) + 22)
since ((25.56876236) + 22) is an integer and
since it can be written as 4 . some integer, therefore its dividible by 4

d. use your answer to part b to explain why 4,650,310 is not divisble by 4
we need to show 4,650,310  = 4 . some integer
4,650,310 = 4,650,300 + 10
= 100 (46503) + 10
= 4 . 25 . 46503 + 4 (2) + 2
= 4 ((25 . 46503) + 2) + 2
since this leave a reminder of 2 therefore it is not divible by 2

problem 3.10
in this problem, we disvoer a method for determining whether or not a number is divisble by 9
notice that 

765 = 7 . 100 + 6 . 10 + 5
= 7 (99 + 1) + 6 (9 + 1) + 5
= 7 . 99 + 7 + 4 . 9 + 6 + 5
= 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + (7 + 6 + 5)

a. as shown above, 765 = 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + (7 + 6 + 5)
notice that 7 + 6 + 5 is divisble by 9. explain why this tells us that 765 is divisible by 9
answer:
continuing from the answer,
= 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + 18
= (7 . 99) + (6 . 9) + (2 . 9)
= 9 (7 . 11 + 6 + 2)
= 9 (77 + 6 + 2)
= 9 (85)
since it can be written sa 9 . some integer where 85 is an integeger
therefore its divisble by 9

b. note that 8 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 18 explain why this tells us that 8154 is divisible by 9
answer: because 18/the total sum is divisible by 9

general proof
8154 = (8 . 1000) + (1 x 100) + (5 x 10) + 4
= (8 x (999 + 1)) + (1 x (99 + 1)) + (5 x (9 + 1)) + 4
= (8 x 999) + (8 x 1) + (99 + 1) + (45 + 5) + 4
= 9 ((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 ) + 8 + 4 + 1 + 5
((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 ) since this is guaranteed to be divisble by 9
the sum of digit is 8+4+1+5 = 18
and 18 is divisibel by 9
= 9 ((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 ) + (9 x 2)
= 9 ((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 + 2)

c. determine wheter or not 59814 is divisible by 9 without dividing 9 into 59814
answer: 59814 -> sum of digits = 5+9+8+1+4 = 27 / 9 = 3
so it is divisble by 9

problem 3.11
a. are both 99 and 9 divisible by 3?
answer:. yesm they are both divibsle by 3
since 99 / 3 = 33 with no reminder
and 9 / 3 / 3 with no reminder

b. is 765 divisibble by 3?
answer: is 765 divisble by 3?
yes becaues 765 = 255 . 3

c. is 67242 divisible by 3?
answer: yes because 67242 = 3. 22414

d. explain why 6148 is not divisble by 3 without dividing 6148 by 3
since 9 is a multiple of 3, we can aple previous sum of digit/ divisble by 9
6+1+4+8 = 19. since 19 is not divisble by 3, 6148 is not divisble by 3

problem 3.12
A is the units digit in the four digit number 4,63A
if 4,63A is divisble by 3 and by 4, then wat are the possible values of a?

answer:
number divisble by 4, last 2 digit must be divisble by 4
32
36

then filter again, number divisble by 3
the sum of its digits must be divisble by 9

sum = 4+6+3+a = 13 + a
case 1: A = 2 -> 4+6+3+2 = 15 -> divisible by 3
case 2: A = 6 -> 4+6+3+6 = 19 -> not divisble by 3
therefore the only possible value for A is 2

problem 3.13
N is the tens digit in the five digit number 24,6N8
If 24,6N8 is divisible by 9, then must 24,6N8 also be divisible by 4?

answer:
24,6N8 is divisible by 9 -> this means the sum of digits must be divisble by 9
find possible values that saisfies this
sum = 2 + 4 + 6 + n + 8 = 20 + n
n = 7 -> 20 + 7 = 27

next check if its divisble by 4
24678 -> last two digit = 78
is 78 divisble by 4? its not divisble by 4

It only needs to be divisible by 4 if the last two digits, 78, were divisible by 4.

=====================
a number is divisible by, if
2 -> must be even
3 -> sum of digits must be multiple of 3
4 -> last d digit is multiple of 4
5 -> last digit is either 0 or 5
9 -> sum of digits is multiple of 9
10 -> last digit is 0



3.2.1
which of the following id divisible by 5
46,624
560,335
60,231,060
9,671,118

answer:
to find a number is dibisble by 5, the lat digit must be either 5 or 0,
so 560,335 and 60,231,060 are both divisible by 5

3.2.2
which of the following numbers are divisble by 4
46,624
560,335
60,231,060
9,671,118
answer:
last 2 digit must be divible by 4
46,624 -> 24 is divisble by 4 ✅
560,335 -> 35 is not divisble by 4 ❌
60,231,060 -> 60 is divisble by 4 ✅
9,671,118 -> 18 is not divisble by 4 ❌

3.2.3

which of the following numbers are not divisble by 7
7,000,014
14,035
7,777,728
42,721,034
49,763
answer:
7,000,014 = 7 . 1000000 + 14 = 7 . 1000000 + 7 . 2 = 7(1000000.2) ✅
14,035 = 7 . 2000 + 7 . 5 = 7 (2000+5) ✅
7,777,728 = 7 . 1111100 + 7 . 4 = 7 (1111104) ✅

therefore 42,721,034

3.2.5
how many numbers from 1 - 400 have a 2 in the units place (ones placee)
and are divisble by 4?
answer:
we know that a number is divisble by 4 if the last 2 digit is also divisble by 4
so we need to find last 2 digit divisble by 4 and the last digit is 2
from 1 - 100 -> 12, 32, 52, 72, 92 = 5 numbers
from 1 - 400 -> 4 x 5 = 20 numbesr

3.2.6
both ABC and 3D8 are 3 digit numbers such that
ABC - 3D8 = 269
if 3D8 is divisble by 9, then what number does ABC represent?
answer:

divisble by 9 -> sum of digit must be divisble by 9
3D8 = 3 + d + 8 = 11 + d
we must find d such that 11 + d is divisble by 9
d = 7 -> 11 + 7 = 18
3D8 = 378

ABC - 378 = 269
ABC = 269 + 378
ABC = 647

3.2.7
what is the largest idgit d for which the number 214,d07 is divisble by 3?
answer:
divisble by 3 mens the sum of digit must also digvisble by 3
214d07 = 2+1+4+d+0+7 = 14 + d
9 -> largest but not divisble by 3
8 doesn't work also
threfore 7 is the largest idgit since 14 + 7 = 21

3.2.8
consider the rules we found to test for divisibility by 2 and 4
can you find a similar rule for divisible by 8?
answer:
we know if number is divisble by 2, the number must be even

we know if number is divisble by 4, last 2 digit must be divisble by 4
516 = 500 + 16 = 5 . (4 . 25) + 4 (4) = 4 (5 . 25) + 4(4) = 4 (125+4) = 4(129)

then for a number divibsle by 4 it must be find the smallest power of 10
that is guaranteed ot be multiple of 8
416 = 8 (50) + 8 (2) = 8 (52)
54320 = 5400 + 320 = (54 . (8 . 125)) . (8 . 40) = 8(54 . 125) . 8(40) = 8(54.125 + 40)

A number is divisible by 8 if and only if the number
formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.


to test a number is divisble by 2, we need
10 = (2 . 5) -> 2 (5)
100 = 4 . 25
1000 = 8 . 125

============================================
Prime Numbers
A prime number is a positive integer that is divisble by exactly 2 positive integers
1 and the number itself

a composite number is a positive integer that is divisibly by
more than 2 positive integers.
this means tat a number is composite if it is divisble by some positive integer
besides 1 and the number itself

answer: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

3.15

Meena is trying to determine whether or not 113 is prime.
She's doing so by checking 113 for divisibility by each positive integer starting with 2.
She sees that 113 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
She then checks if 113 is divisible by 3. Since 1+1+3= 5 is not divisible by 3,
she knows that 113 is not divisible by 3.
(a) Meena says, "Since 113 is not divisible by 2,
I know that 113 isn't divisible by 4." Is she right? Why or why not?
answer:
her answer is correct 
to check if a number is divisble by 4 the last 2 digit must be divisble by 4
113 -> 13 is not divisble by 4, therefore its not divisbe
If a number fails the test for 2, it's impossible for it to pass the test for 4.

(b) How does Meena know at a glance that 113 is not divisible by 5?
answer: because the last digit is not either 0 or 5

(c) She then says, "Since 113 is not divisible by 2,
I know that it isn't divisible by 6." Is she right? Why or why not?
answer: correct because 6 has a factor of 2
any number divisble by 6 is also divisble by 2

(d) Meena divides 113 by 7 and finds a remainder of 1,
so she knows that 113 is not divisible by 7. She then says,
"I don't have to test 8, 9, or 10. I know that 113 isn't divisible by 
ny of those." How does she know without testing?
8 -> since we testd ealrier the number is not divisble by 2, therefore its not divisble by 8
9 -> sum of digit we tested earlier, its not divisble by 3, therefore not divisbel by 9
and 10 -> we tested earlier number is not divisble by5, therefore not idvisble by 10

(e) Meena then says, "Since 11^2 is 121, I don't have to test any numbers
higher than 10. I now know that 113 is prime." Why doesn't Meena have to test any
more numbers?

====================================

if a number is not divisble by a prime,
then it is not divisble by any multiple of that prime
to check for primarlity
we only need to test if that number is divisble by prime numbers

to check if a number is prime,
we only need to test if it is divisble by primes
whose squares are less than or equal to the number we are testing

therefore 71,73,79

3.3.3
what is the largest prime number p such that 8 times p is less than 1000?
answer:
8 . p = 1000
p = 125
which means we need to find prime number p less than 125
113

3.3.4
how many pairs of primes are there such that the sum of pair is 40?
largest prime least than 40 =
37 and 3
29 + 11
17 + 23

3.3.5
a. the product of all prime numbers between 1 and 80 is divided by 10
what is the remiander?
answer: 
(2*3*5*7*...*79) / 10
we know that  (2*3*5*7*...*79) is a prime
and since theres 2 and 5 there we can rewrite it as
(/ * 5) (3 * 7 * .. * 79)
p = 10 * all other prime factors
therefore the reminder is 0

b. the product of all prime numbers between 1 and 80 is divided by 4
what is the reminder?
answer:
(2*3*5*7*...*79) / 4
since the only even number in prime is 2,
and it contains only one factor of 2

p = 2 . (product of all odd primes)
(3 * 5 * 7 * ... * 79) / 2
therefore the reminder is 2

3.3.6
how many groups of three prime numbers add to 22?
note 2,3,5 is considered as the same group of three primes as (3,2,5)

3 primes up to 22 = 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19
even + even
1 -> (13+7) + 2 

3.3.7
suppose P and Q both represent prime numbers such that
5p + 7q = 109

find the value sof the prime p
answer:
5p = 109 - 7q
p = 109 - 7q / 5

check q one by one 
q = 2 -> 109 - 14 / 5 = 19 -> prime
q = 3 -> 109 - 21 / 5 = not integer
q = 5 -> 109 - 35 / 5 = not integer
q -> 7 -> 109 - 49 / 5 = 12 -> not prime
q -> 11 -> 109 - 77 / 5 = 12 -> not intger

therefore q = 2 and p = 19

a. 16
b. 36
c. 81
d. 144
how can we use prime factorization of a number to tell
whter or not the number is a perfect suqare
answer:
a. 16 = 4 . 4 = 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 = 2^4
b. 36 = 2 . 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^2 . 3^2
c. 81 = 9 . 9 = 3 . 3 . 3 . 3 = 3^4
d. 144 = 12 . 12 = (2 . 2 . 3) (2 . 2 . 3)= 2^4 . 3^2
a number is a perfect square if and only if
all of the exponents in prime factorization are even numbers

3.22
what positive integer squared equals 96 . 486?
answer:
im guessing you cna tell the integer based from the prime factors? not sure
prime factors of 96 = 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 = 2^5 . 3^1
prime factors of 486 = 2 . 3 . 3 . 3 . 3 . 3 = 3^5 . 2^1

n^2 = 2^1 . 2^5 . 3^1 . 3^5
n^2 = 2^6 . 3^6
n = 2^3 . 3^3 = 216

3.23
paul multiplies two positive integers and get a productof 16000
if neither of pauls integers ends in 0 wthat is the sum of pauls integers?

neither integer cannot ends in 0, so no factors of 10 = no 2 or 5
16000 = 160 * 100 -> has 0 digit last, not valid
16000 prime factors = 16 . 1000 = 4^2 . (2.5)^3 = 4^2 . 2^3 . 5^3
= 2^4 . 2^3 . 5^3 = 2^7 . 5^3
so a . b = 2^7 . 5^3
neither a nor b can end in 0
128 + 125 = 253

3.24
a. let n be the product of 10 smallest prie numbers
explain why prime factorialization of n+1 must include a prime that isnt among the 10 smalles prime numbers

answer:
n+1 = 2 toimes some integer , so n+1 must be odd -> n+2 is nt dividible by 2
n+1 = 3 times some integer , n+1 is nt dividible by 3
n+1 = 5 times some itneger, n+1 is not divisble by 5
n+1 is not divisble by any of these itesm in p1,p2,p...p10

this means the prime factorization of n+1 does not include p1,p2,p3,p...,p10
therefore the prime factors of n+1 are greater than p10


since n+1 leaves non-zero reminder when divided by prime 
none of the mslalest 10 primes can be a factor of n+1

therefore n+1 must be tiehr a new prime number of a product of new prime numbers

im guessing since its larger it cannot be breaken down so it needs the next prime?

b. let n be the 100 smallest prime nubers. explain why prime factorization of n+1
mst include a prime that isn't among the 100 smallest pime numbers

let n = p1 . p2 . p3 ... p100
by definition n is divisble by each item in p

then n+1 will always lave reminder of 1
since it leaves nonzero reminder whendivided by each item in p none of these can be factor of n+1

therefore it can be a prime number



c. explain why there is not a largest prime number
that is explain why there are infinitely many primes
answer:
because number is inifite? not sure


====================================================

Fundamental theory of arithmetic
every posiive integer has a unique prime factorization

primes are building blocks of integers
every integer > 1 can be expressed as a product of primes in exactly one way
prime factorization can be particularly useful in problems involving products of integers.

====================================================

all of the exponents in prime factorization of a perfect squares are even
any prime factorization in which all of the exponents is even is the prime factorization
of a perfect square.

================================

Exercise 3.4.1

3.4.2
what is the largest prime factor of 6886?
2 . 11 . 313
sqrt 313 = ~17
since 313 is not divisble by prime factor up to 17 therefore 313 is prime
therefore 313 is the largest prime factor

3.4.3
is x,y,and z are positive integers and 2^x . 3^y . 5^z = 54000
what is the value of x + y + z
answer

2^x . 3^y . 5^z = 54000
find prime fafctors of 54000
54 . 1000
54 . 125 . 8
(3 . 3 . 2 . 3) . (5 . 5 . 5) (2 . 2 . 2 ) 
(3 . 3 . 3) . (5 . 5 . 5) (2 . 2 . 2 . 2) 
2^4 . 3^3 . 5^3
therefore x = 4, y = 3, z = 3
so the sum is 5 + 3 + 3 = 10

3.4.4
what is the smallest possitive perfect suqare that is divisble
by four smallest primes?

we konw the four smallest prime = 2,3,5,7

we need to find perfect square divisble by any of these
(2.3.5.7)^2
= 210^2
= 44100??

b. how does the answer to part a change if we remove the word "positive"?
answer:
so smallest negative perfect square?
0

3.4.5
the product of tow positive integers is 504 and
each of the numbers is divisble by 6
however neither of the two integers is 6
what is the larger of th two integers?

answer:
x . y = 504
x and y is divisible by 6
but x and y does not equal 6

find prime factorization of 504
8 . 63
8 . 7 . 9

2^3 . 3^2 . 7^1
(2 . 3) . (2 . 3) . (2 . 7)
= 6 . 6 . 14
= (6 . 2) (6 . 7)
= 12 . 42
so x = 12 and y = 42 this follows the rule
therefore the largest number is 42

3.4.6
in the equation 858 = a . b
the numbers a and b are both positive two digit integers
what is the greatest possible value for a + b ?

answer:
find prime factors of 858
858 = 11 . 6 . 13 = 6 . 11 . 13 = 2 . 3 . 11 . 13

greatest possible value for a + b
(2 . 11) (3 . 13)
= 22 . 39 -> 22 + 39 = 61

(2 . 13) (3 . 11)
= 26 . 33 -> 26 + 33 = 59

(2 . 3 . 11) . (13)
= 66 . 13
= 89

3.4.7
in problem 3.21 we learned that all of the exponents must be even
in the prime factorization of a perfect square.
is there a similar fact for perfect cubes?
how can we tell from looking at the prime factorization of a positive integer wheter or not
the integer is a perfect cube?

answer:
so in perfect square case we need to check if the prime factors have even exponent
2^2 . 3^2 = 4 . 9 = 36 = 6^2
(prime factors)^2 = perfect square 

in perfect cube im guessting..
(prime factors)^3 = perfect cube? so it needs to be odd?
lets test it
2^3 . 3^3 = 8 . 27 = 216 = 6^3
seems to be working but not sure

the exponents need to be multiple of 3

3.4.8
a. the number of 40! (40! is spoken "40 factorial")
is defined as the product of all integers from 1 through 40

40! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x 40

in the prime factorization of 40!, what is the power of 5?
answer:


5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40

25 = 5^2
9

b. if a number ends in zeroes, those zeroe are claled terminal zeros
for example, 40000 has four terminal zeros,
but 104000 has just three terminal zeros
how many terminal zeros does 40! have?

answer:
zero is made from multiple of 2 . 5

find factorsof 5 up t o40
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 = 9 total

40! = 2^n . 2^9
we can make 9 pairs of (2 . 5) with reminder factor of 2
threfore 9 terminal zeroes

=====================================

Least common multiple

if a number is a multiple of both a and b,
that number is a common multiple of a and b.

lcm(a,b) = product of all primes(highest power)
we can extend to any number of integers, not just a,b / two inputs
lcm(a,b,c) = producto f all primes (highest power)

problems
3.25
a. list all five smallest positive multiples of 18
b. list all five smallest positive multiples of 24
c. list all three smallest positive common multiples of 18 and 24
d. what is the least common multiple of 18 and 24?
how are the common multiples you found in part c related to the least common
multiple?

answer:
a. 18, 36, 54, 72, 90
b. 24, 48, 72, 96, 120
c. list all three smallest positive common multiples of 18 and 24
72, 144, 216

d. 72
18 = 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^1 . 3^2
24 = 2 . 2 . 2 . 3 = 2^3 . 3^1
lcm = 2^3 . 3^2

Every common multiple of two numbers
is a multiple of their LCM.

Problem 3.26
find the prime factorizations of the five smallest positive multiples of 18
compare these prime factorizations to the prime factorizations of 18
do you notice anything interesting?

mutiples of 18 = 18, 36, 54, 72, 90
PF of 18 -> 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^1 . 3^2
PF of 36 -> 2 . 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^2 . 3^2
PF of 54 -> 3 . 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^1 . 3^3
PF of 72 -> 2 . 2 . 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^3 . 3^2
PF of 90 -> 2 . 3 . 3 . 5 = 2^1 . 3^2 . 5^1

it seems they all have at least 2^1 . 3^2
every multiple of 18 must contain 2^1 . 3^2 (PF of 18) as a subset of its factor


3.27
the prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 . 3^2
use the given prime factorization of each number below to determine if the number
is a multiple of 72

a. 864 = 2^5 . 3^3
b. 400 = 2^4 . 5^2
c. 1008 = 2^4 . 3^2 . 7^1
d. 2916 = 2^2 . 3^6

answer:
since prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 . 3^2 we must find if each
has at lesat a subset of their prime factorizations

a. 864 = 2^5 . 3^3 -> (2^3 . 3^2) . 2^2 . 3^1
this fits so yes its a multiple of 72

b. 400 = 2^4 . 5^2 is not multiple of 72 since 3^2 is not a prime factorization

c.  1008 = 2^4 . 3^2 . 7^1
(2^3 . 3^2) . 2^1 . 7^1 - fits so it is a muultiple of 72

d.  2^2 . 3^6 -> does not fit since it needs at least one more 2


suppose we have prime factorizations of two positive integers m and n
how can we use the prime factorizations to tell if m is a multiple of n?

m must contain at least all prime factors of n (rule of divisiiblity)
exponent in m >= exponent in n

3.28
how can we use the prime factorizations of 24 and 90 to find lcm (24,90)?
answer:

pf of 24 -> 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 -> 2^3 .  3^1
lcm of 90 ->  2 . 3 . 3 . 5 -> 2^1 . 3^2 . 5^1

greatest pwoer of 2 -> 2^3
greatest power of 3 -> 3^2
greatest power of 5 -> 5^1

= 2^3 . 3^2 . 5^1
= 8 . 9 . 5 = 360

tto find the LCM, take every prime factor that appears in either number,
raised to the highest power it appears.

3.29
compute each of the following:
a. lcm[96, 144]
b. lcm[28,35]
c. lcm[2^2 . 3^3 . 5^1, 3^3 . 5^2 . 7^1]
d. lcm[24, 36, 42]

answer:
a. pf 96 -> 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 = 2^5 . 3^1
pf 144 -> 12 . 12 = 2 . 2 . 3 . 2 . 2 . 3 = 2^4 . 3^2

therefore the lcm is the combined lcm with the greatest power
2^5 . 3^2 = 288

b. pf 28 -> 2 . 2 . 7 = 2^2 . 7^1
pf 35 -> 5 . 7 = 5^1 . 7^1

lcm = 2^2 . 5^1 . 7^1 = 140  

c. the highest of these factors are
2^2 . 3^3 . 5^2 . 7^1 = 4 . 27 . 25 . 7 = 18900

d. 24 = 2 . 2 . 2 . 3 = 2^3 . 3^1
36 = 3 . 2 . 2 . 3 = 2^2 . 3^2
42 = 2 . 3 . 7 = 2^1 . 3^1 . 7^1

therfore the lcm is 2^3 . 3^2 . 7^1 = 8 . 9 . 7 = 504

3.30
a. are lcm [2.500, 2.300] and lcm[500,300] equal?
answer:

first check lcm[2.500,2.300]
2.500 -> 2 . 5 . (5 . 5 . 4) = 2^1 . 2^2 . 5^3
2.300 -> 2 . 3 . 5 . 5 . 4 = 2^1 . 3^1 . 2^2 . 5^2

so the lcm is 
3^1 . 2^3 . 5^3 = 2 . 3 . 4 . 125 = 3000

now check lcm[500,300]
500 ->  5 . (5 . 5 . 2^2) = 2^2 . 5^3
300 -> 3 . 5 . 5 . 2^2 =  2^2 . 3^1 . 5^2
so the lcm is 3^1 . 2^2 . 5^3 = 1500

now compare both
3000 = 2 (1500)
therefore yes it is equal.

generalization:
i think since they both share a common factor of 2 we can
just pull the factor out safely

k increases all powers


b. let a and b be positive integer. must we have lcm[2a,2b] = 2lcm[a,b]
answer:
yes because lcm[2a,2b] have the common factor of 2
by factoring out the 2 we esentially just pul out the additional power of the prime factorizaztion
and then multiply it at the end


c. let a and bbe positive integer. must we have lcm[15a,15b] = 15lcm[a,b]?
same as answer b, with 15 as the common factor

d. compute lcm[606060,707070]
answer: this is the same as 101010 . lcm [6,7]
and lcm [6.7] is
6 -> 2^1 . 3^1
7 -> 7^1
= 2^1 . 3^1 . 7^1 = 42

= 101010 . 42 = 4242420

a church rings its bells every 15 minutes
the scrool rings its bells evey 20 minutes
the day care center rings its bells every 25 minutes
if they all ring their bells at noon on the same day, at what time they next
all ring their bells together?

answer:
find lcm[15,20,25]
15 -> 3 . 5
20 -> 4 . 5 = 2^2 . 5
25 -> 5 . 5 = 5^2

lcm = 2^2 . 3^1 . 5^2 = 300
since the bell rings at noon just add 300 minutes after noon,
so 300 / 60 = 5 hours
so it would be at 5 PM

3.32
the number 16128 is a multiple of 6,7, and 8
what is the smallest multiple of 6,7,8 that is greater than 16128?
answer:
find lcm[6,7,8]
6 -> 2^1 . 3^1
7 -> 7^1
8 -> 2^3

lcm = 2^3 . 3^1 . 7^1 = 168
we must find a number multiple of these that is greater than 16128
we know that 168 * 100 = 16800
168*4=672 -> 16800 - 672 = 16128 -> equal 
168*3=504 -> 16800 - 504 = 16296 -> nex smallest multiple of 6,7,8 larger than 16128
therfore 16296

3.33
a. what is the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that leaves
a reminder of 1 when divided by each 6,7, and 8?
answer: 
we know from the previous question the lcm of 6,7,8 is 168
A number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, 7, and 8
must be one more than a number that is exactly divisible by all three.
so the smallest positive integer is 169

b. find the smallest positive number
that leaves a reminder of 5 when divided by 6
a reminder of 6 when divided by 7
and a reminder by 7 when divided by 8

3.5.3
in this section we defined the least common multiple of 
two postiive integer
why didn't we define the greatest common multiple?
answer:
because there is no such thing as greatest ocmmon multiple
since the greatest multiple can reach infinite

if we try to define greatest common multple of gcm[2,3]
then we would have to search infinite possibility of these multiple and find
for the "greatest"

3.5.4
what is the largest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 200?
answer:
we know that lcm[8,12] = 4 . lcm [2,3] = 4 . 6 = 24
we need to find largest multiple of 24 that is less than 200
we know 24 . 10 = 240
24 . 9 = 216
24 . 8 = 192

therefore 192 is the largest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 200

so the lcm is 2^2 . 3 . 5 . 7 = 4 . 3 . 5 . 7 = 420

now we need to find the smallest four digit
we know 420 * 2 = 840
we know 420 * 3 = 1260

therefore 1260 is the answer

alex counted to 2400 by 6s begining with 6
mathew counted to 2400 by 4s starting with 4

how many numbers counted by alex were also counted by matthew?

answer:
first we need to find lcm[6,4] and count these multiples up to 2400
= 2 . lcm[3,2]
= 2 . 6 = 12

next hwo many multiples of 12 are there up to 2400, we need to count it

since we know 2400 / 12 = 200
the answer is 200

the people at a party tried to form teams with the same number on each team
but when they tried to split up into teams of 2, 3, 5 or 7, exactly one person was left
without a team. what is the smallest numbero f people (greater than 1) who could
have been at the party?

answer:

first find the lcm and then calcualte the reminder
lcm[2,3,5,7] = 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 = 210

since one person was left then we know its one more than 210 +1 = 211

3.5.8
one owl hoots every 3 hrs
2nd owl hoots every 8h
third owl hoots every 12h

if they all hoot together at the start
how many times during the next 80h will just the two of the owls hoot together

answer:
lcm[3,8,12]
3 -> 3
8 -> 2^3
12 -> 2 . 2 . 3
= 8 . 3 = 24

the tree owls hoot together every the 24th hour
next 80 hours -> 80 / 24 =  3 with a reminder of 8
1st 24 -> all 3 hoots
2nd 48 -> all 3 hoots
3rd 72 -> all 3 hoots

pair 1 -> 3h and 8h
lcm[3,8] = 24, the same as lcm[3,8,12]

pair 2 -> 3h and 12h
lcm[3,12] -> 3, 2 . 2 . 3 = 2^2 . 3^1 = 12
80/12 -> hoots 6 times with rmiender of 8
This pair hoots together 6 times: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72.
since the three cannot be hoot toghether only include 3

pair 3 -> 8h and 12h
lcm[8,12] -> 4 . lcm [2,3] = 4 . 6 = 24
the same as lcm[3,8] and lcm[3,8,12]

therfore 3 times from pair 2

29 -> 1, 29
30 -> 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30

the answer is 25 since it has 3 count

c. which positive integers have an odd number of posisitve divisors?
based from preivous answers we have 9,16,25
seems like a square
3^2, 4^2, 5^2
so im guessing positive integer of squares have odd number of positive divisors?

3.36
note that 20 is a divisor of 60
a. must every divisor of 20 also be a divisor of 60?
answer:

divisors of 20
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
60 / 1 -> 60, divisible
60 / 2 -> 30, divisible
60 / 4 -> 15, divisible
60 / 5 -> 12, divisible
60 / 10 -> 6, divisible
60 / 20 -> 3, divisible

therefore yes, every divisor of 20 must be a divisor of 60
(transitivity of divisibility)

b. must every divisor of 60 also be a divisor of 20?
im going to say yes here instead of counting every divisor of 60 ince they share the same factor?
30 and 60 are not divisors of 20

3.37
a. suppose 3 is divisor of k, is 3 a divisor of k + 3?
answer:
3 is a divisor of k ->  3 | k -> k / 3
is 3 a divisor kf k + 3?  -> k + 3 / 3

lets pick a random k, say 6
6 + 3 / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3

yes since k is already divisible by 3 (3 is divisor of k),
adding 3 to k is just adding another factor of 3

generalization
k = 3m for some integer m
k + 3 = (3m) + 3
k + 3 = 3(m+1) since m+1 is an integer k+3 is a multiple of 3

b. suppose 3 is divisor of both b and c, must 3 be divisor of b + c?

b = 3m for some integer m
c = 3n for some integer n

b + c = 3m + 3n
= 3(m + n)

since m+n is an integer therefore 3 is a divisor  of b + c

c. suppose 3 is a divisor of b + c, must 3 be a divisor of both b and c?

b + c = 3m
b = 3m - c
c = 3m - b

doesn't seem liek it, not sure
countereexample:
b = 2
c = 1
sum = 3

so the answer is no

====================================

transitivity of dividibility
if a is a divisor of b, then every divisor of a is also a divisor of b

====================================

Divisibility of a Sum and Difference
let a,b, and c be integers.
if c is a divisor of a and b , then
c is a divisor of a + b and a - b

the prime factorization of 1944 is 2^3 . 3^5
below are three numbers and their prime factorizations
in each part use the prim efactorization of the number to determine if the number
is a divisor of 1944
a. 108 = 2^2 . 3^3
this is a factor since we know 2^3 . 3^5
just add 2^1 . 3^2 . (2^3 . 3^5)

b. 45 = 3^2 . 5^1
not a factor since 1944 does not have 5 as it prime factor

c. 48 = 2^4 . 3^1
not a factor sinc  2^4 exceeds 2^3

suppose we have 2 integers m and n
how can we tell from the prime factorizations of m and n wheter or not
m is a dvisior of n?

m is a divisor/factor of n if m's pf exponent is less than or equal n
if m does not have the same base prime factorization or if the power exceeds its not a factor

 Every prime factor of m must also be a prime factor of $n$.

how can we use the prime factorizations of 360 and 48 to find gcd(360,48)?
answer:
find pfs of each numbers
360 -> 2 . 9 . 2 . 2 . 5 = 2^3 . 5^1 . 3^2
48 -> 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 = 2^4 . 3^1
the gcd is the common prime factors of each with the lowestp ower

9 -> 3^2

gcd = 1
lcm = 2^2 . 3^3 = 4 . 9 = 36

b. find gcd (10,27) and lcm (10,27)
10 -> 2^1 . 5^1
27 -> 3^3

gcd = 1
lcm = 2^1 . 5^1 . 3^3 = 10 . 27 = 270

c. let a and b be positive integer such that gcd(a,b) = 1
explain why lcm(a,b) = ab

smal example
let a = 2 and b = 5
gcd(2,5) = 1 since htey both share no common factor
lcm(2,5) = 2^1 . 5^1 = 10

im guessing if the gcd of two numbers are 1
that must mean that both numbers are only divisible by 1 and they share no common factors
so the lcm must be the multiple of both / combine the factors together?
eg take the highest power of both  prime factor in a and b
since they are completely seperate combining them is simply multiplying them as a . b


3.46
a. must a number that is a multiple of 4 and 9 be a multiple of 36?
answer:
small example, a number that is multiple of both 4 and 9
lcm(4,9) = 2^2 . 3^2 = 36
pf of 4 = 2^2
pf of 9 = 3^2
x = (2^2 . 3^2) . k
x = 36 . k
since k is an integer threfore it is multiple of 36

b. must a number that is a multiple of 3 and 12 be a multiple of 36?
answer:
3 -> 3^1
12 -> 2^2 . 3^1
lcm -> 2^2 . 3^1 = 12
x = (12) . k for some integer k
counterexample: k = 1
x = 12
12 is not a multiple of 36


c. find the digit A such that 59,7A6 is a multiple of 36
answer:
multiple of 36 -> also a multiple of 4 or 9

36 -> 4 . 9 = 2^2 . 3^2

so the sum of digits must be 3 or 9

59,7A6 -> current digit sum = 5+9+7+a+6
= 27 + a

a = 9 -> 27 + 9 = 36 -> 59796
a = 0 -> 27 + 0 = 27 -> 59706

answer:
if i remmeber a number a and b is relatigvely prime / coprime if they share no
common/similar prime factorizaiton, 
or their gcd is 1
lets check 1 by 1

15 -> 3 . 5 = 3^1 . 5^1
18 -> 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^1 . 3^2
they have 3 pfs which is similar, so not coprime

12 -> 2 . 2 . 3 = 2^2 . 3^1
18 -> 2 . 3 . 3 = 2^1 . 3^2
they both share 2 and 3 as prime factors, not coprime

if 661,17A is a multiple of 12, then what is A?

since its a multiple of 12, it means its also a multiple of the factors of 12
so 1,2,3,4,6,12

2 -> number need to be even
3 -> sum of digit must be divisible by 3
4 -> last 2 digit must be divisible by 4

n = 6+6+1+1+7+a 
n = 21 + a

a = 0
21 is divisible by 3
70 is not divisble by 4

a = 3
24 is divisible by 3
73 is not divisble by 4

a = 6
27 is divisible by 3
76 is divisibel by 4

therefore a = 6

To test for divisibility by a composite number, we can test for divisibility

3.7.6
let a,b, and c b integers such that a and b are relatively prime
and b and c are relatively prime
must a and c be relatively prime?

answer:
since we know a and b are relatively prime we can expres as

gcd(a,b) = 1
which means they share no common prime factors and 1 as the only common divisor

since b and c are relatively prime
gcd(b,c) = 1
this means b and c share no common prime factors other than 1

counterexample
let a = 2
let b = 3
let c = 4

gcd(2,3) = 1
gcd(3,4) = 1

but gcd (2,4) = 2

relatively prime is not a transitive property

the number A2473B is a six digit integer in which a and b are digits
and the number is divisible by 72
find the value of a and the value of b

answer:
divisible by 72 = 
2 . 2 . 2 . 9 = 8 . 9
the last 3 digit must be divisible by 8
the sum of digit must be divisible by 9

a+2+4+7+3+b = a+16+b

focus on b, last 3 digit divisible by 8
73b = divisible by 8 -> 736
therefore b = 6

now finding a
a+16+6 = a + 22
find number 20 - 29 that is divisibble by 9
27 -> therefore a = 5

so a = 5 and b = 6

find the largest factor of 2520 that is not divisible by 6

hint: how must a prime factorization
ofa divisor of 2520 be related to the prime factorization of 2520?

hint: if a number is not a multiple of 6,
then what must be true about its prime factorization?

asnwer:
we know the number is 2520
lets find the prime factorization
2520 = 7 . 9 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 5 = 2^3 . 3^2 . 5^1 . 7^1

not divisible by 6 means its prime factorization must be missing at least one
of the two primes (not divisible by 2 or not divisilbe by 3)

case a: factor must not be divisible by 2
9 . 5 . 7 = 315

case b: factor must not be divisilbe by 3
8 . 5 . 7 = 280

therefore the largest factor is 315

jack finds the product of three idfferent prime numbers
is it possible for the sum of the digits of jack's product to be 18?

why or why not?
hint: what do you know about a number whose digits sum to 18?

answer:
a . b . c = 18

if a number has a sum of digits of 18, it means
its divisible by 9

therefore it must contain 3^2 as its prime factorization
so at least 3^2 must be included
3^2 . b . c = 18

for p to have 3^2 as a factor at least two of the primes must be 3
but the problem restricts that thep rimes must be unique
therefore it is not possible to achieve such thing

3.79
the lcm of 12,15,2 and k is 420
what is the least possible value of the positive integer k?

hint: how do you find the lcm of a group of number?
what must be true about k in order for lcm(12,15,20,k) to be 420?

answer:
k must be a factor of 420

lcm(12,15,20,k) = 420
12 -> 2^2 . 3^1
15 -> 3^1 . 5^1
20 -> 2^2 . 5^1
target lcm (420) -> 2^2 . 3^1 . 5^1 . 7^1

multiply pfs with highest power
lcm = 2^2 . 3^1 . 5^1 . k = 60 . k

60 . k = 420

lcm(60,k) = 420
pfs of 420 -> 7 . 3 . 3 . 2 . 5 = 2^2 . 3^1 . 5^1 . 7^1
pfs of 60 -> 3 . 3 . 2 . 5 = 2^2 . 3^1 . 5^1

k = 7

for each following pair of number find the producto f the number and then find
the product of the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of the numbers

a. 18,24
answer:
18 . 24 = 432
gcd(18,24) = 6 . gcd (3,4) = 6 . 1 = 6
lcm(18,24) = 6 . lcm (3,4) = 6 . 12 = 72

product of lcm . gcd = 432

b. 35,42
35 . 42 = 1470

35 -> 5 . 7 = 5^1 . 7^1
42 -> 6 . 7 = = 2 . 3 . 7 = 2^1 . 3^1 . 7^1

gcd = 7^1 = 7
lcm = 2^1 . 3^1 . 5^1 . 7^1 = 210

lcm . gcd = 7 . 210 = 1470

c. 66,84
66 * 84 = 5544
66 -> 2 . 3 . 11 = 2^1 . 3^1 . 11^1
84 -> 7 . 2 . 2 . 3 = 2^2 . 3^1 . 7^1

gcd = 2^1 . 3^1 = 6
lcm = 2^2 . 3^1 . 7^1 . 11^1 = 924
gcd . lcm = 6 . 924 = 5544

c. do you seee an interesting pattern in your answer? what pattern
will hold true for any two positive integers you start with? if so why?
answer:

the pattern is this:
the product of two integers a and b is equal to
the product of their gcd and lcm

so a * b = gcd(a,b) . lcm(a,b)

this is because of prime factorization

if we take the prime factorization of 
LHS
n^x where x is the largest pf
n^y wher y is the largest pf

by law of exponent its n^x+y

RHS
since we know gcd holds the smalest prime its n^(min a,b)
since we know lcm holds the largest prime its n^(max a,b)

x+y = min(x,y) + max(x+y)

alternatie answer

3 cases:
case a: prime does not appear in PFs of a and b

case b: prime paprears in pfs of exaclty one of a or b
gcd
since b conains no prime, the prime
power of p of gcd(a,b) = p^0 = 1

since common factor must divide both number and p does not divide b
therefore p is not a prime factor of gcd(a,b)


case c: prime appears in a and b

how many terminal zeores does the integer equal to 80^16 . 75^8 have?

hint: multiply an integer by 10 means you add 0 to the end of integer
how do you get factors of 10
hint: how might the prime factorization of tne number help you?

answer:
so we have
80^16
75^8

find pfs of each base
80 = 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 5 = 2^4 . 5
75 = 5 . 5 . 3 = 3^1 . 5^2

= (2^4 . 5)^16 . (3^1 . 5^2)^8
= 2^64 . 5^16 . 3^8 . 5^16
= 2^64 . 5^32 . 3^8
= (2.5)^32 . 2^32 . 3^8
= 10^32 . 2^32 . 3^8

therefore it has 32 termninal zeroes

the number 64 is both perfect cube and perfect square
since4^3 = 64 and 8^2 = 64

what is the next larger number that is both a
perfect cube and perfect square

hint: all of the exponents in the PFs of a perfect square must be even
what similar fact is true about exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect cube?

64 -> 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 = 2^6
square -> exponents in pfs must be even
cube -> exponents must be divisible by 3

so next perfect cube * square must be even and divisisble by 3
2^6
2^12 -> 4096

3^6 = 729 therefore 729 is the answer


3.83
suppose that a and b are positive integers with a greater than b and
with lcm[a,b] = 462 and gcd(a,b) = 33

find largest prime factor of a that is not a prime factor of b

hint: how do you usualy find lcm and gcd of two numbers?
can you use that process to start from given values of lcm(a,b) and gcd(a,b) to learn about a and b?

hint: what do the prime factorization of lcm(a,b) and gcd(a,b) tell you about the prime factoriztions of a and b?

answer:
we know that a > b
lcm(a,b) = 462
gcd(a,b) = 33
their product is 462.33 = 15246 (not sure if this is relevant/important but lets see)

we need to find the largest prime factor of a that is not a prime factor of b
lets find the pfs of the gcd and lcms
lcm -> 462 = 7 . 11 . 2 . 3 = 2^1 . 3^1 . 7^1 . 11^1
gcd -> 3^1 . 11^1

usually to find lcm you multiply prime factors with highest power
and to find gcd only multiple common prime factors with lowest power

which means a and b 
2^1 . 3^1 . 7^1 . 11^1 -> appears in a or b
3^1 . 11^1 -> appears both in a and b

a = 33 . x
b = 33 . y
were missing a factor 2^1 and 7^1
since a > b 

a = 33 . 7 = 231 -> 3,7,11
b = 33 . 2 = 66 -> 2,3,11

therefore pf of a that is not pf of b = 7


==============================

the prime factors of  gcd(a,b) must be a subset of prime factors lcm(a,b)

what is the smallest positive multiple of 45 that has only 0s and 1s as digits?

hint: we don't know a dividibility rule for 45, but we do know divisibility rules for some of the divisors of 45

answer:
ok so we nee to find smallest positive multiple of 45
that has only 1s and 0s as digits

45 = 9 . 5 -> 3^3 . 5^1
so we need to find a number such that satisfies both:
divisibilty by 9 -> sum of digits must be divisible by 9
divisibility by 5 -> last digit ends with either 0 or 5

2 digit
10, 01, -> too small

3 digit
110 -> not a multiple of 45

...
10 digit
111111110 -> sum = 9, ends with 0
is it the smallest?
remove digit? cant remove since removing means subtracting the sum of digits further

rearrange the 1s and 0s
101111111 -> invalid, ends with 1

so the answer is 111111110

3.85
what is the sum of digits of the number (10^22 + 8) / 9?

hint: this problem involves dividing by 9
what key insight did we kame in the text to help us learn how to test
divisibility by 9?

answer:
10^22 + 8 -> the sum of digits = 1 + (21 zeroes) + 8 = 9
10^22 + 8 is divisible by 9

break into smaller parts
10^1 + 8 / 9 = 18/9 = 2
10^2 + 8 / 9 = 108/9 = 12 -> add 2-1 = 1 "ones" in front of the number
10^3 + 8 / 9 = 1008/9 = 112 -> add 3-2 = 2 "ones" in front of the number

it seems that for everytime we increase the exopnent, it adds n-1 "ones" to the front where n is the exponent
so by the pattern
10^22 + 8 = 21 "ones" followed by 2
so sum of digits = 21 + 2 = 23

how many positive integers less than 1000 are divisible by 2 and 3 but not 5?
hint: simplify the prbolem first. coun numberse less than 1000 that are divisble by 2 and 3
hint: the count you did for the first hint included a lot of umltiples of 5. how many?

answer:
positive integers <100 divisible by both 2 and 3:
gcd(2,3) = 6
6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60,66,72,78,84,90,96 -> total = 16 numbers

999 / 6 -> 166 with 3 reminder

999 / 30 -> 33

remove 166 - 33 = 133

the lockers in my school are numbered from 1 - 1000
initially they are closed
there are 1000 students in my shool
1st student goes through and opens every lorcker
2nd student goes through and open, if locker is closed she opens it, if locker is open she closes it
3rd student does the same way every 3rd locker
4th student does every 4th locker
until all 1000 students have gone through the school

after all students have finished how many lockers are open?

hint: lets say that a student touches a locker if she either opens or closes the locker
which student touch locker 6? which student touch locker 7? locker 8? locker 9?
answer:

1st student -> open every locker, so all 1000 lockers are open
2nd student -> touches every even number -> so all even numbered locker is now closed
so 2,4,8,...,1000 number locker is now closed. total locker open now = 1000/2 = 500
3rd student -> touches locker that is multiple of 3.
since we know from 2nd student that even numbered lockers are closed, we need to find the intersection
3,6,9,12,...
4th student -> touches locker multiple of 4


lets try another approach
if a locker is touched odd times, it ends up open
closed -> open -> closed -> open
if a locker touched even times, it ends up closed
closed -> open -> closed -> open -> closed

which student touch locker 12?
divisors of 12 = 1,2,3,4,6,12 = 6 students -> final door state = closed since its even 

find number with odd number of divisors
locker 4 -> 1,2,4 -> open
locker 9 -> 1,3,9 -> open
locker 16 -> 1,2,4,8,16 -> open

how many perfect squares between 1 and 1000
there are 31 perfect squares since 32^2 = 1024

what is the sum of two smallest multiples of 6
that are greater than 103?
answer:
smallest multiples of 6 = divisible by 2 and 3
so the number needs to be even
and the sum of digits needs to be diviisble by 6

104 -> even but sod = 6
105 -> sod = 6, but odd
106 -> sod = 7
..
108 -> sod = 9, even -> first smallest
find the second smallest
114 -> sod = 6, even -> second smallest
therefore the sum = 108 + 114 = 222

we learned that a number is divisible by 5 if its units digit
is 0 or 5
what is a similar rule that we can test if a number is
divisible by 25
answer:
im guessting 2 things: needs to be diviisble by 5
and must have a factor of 5^5 = 25?

test:
find small number divisible by 25
25 -> 5^1 . 5^1 = 5^2
50 -> 5^1 . 5^1 . 2^1 = 2^1 . 5^2
75 -> 5^1 . 5^1 . 3^1 = 3^1 . 5^2

ok so it must have a factor of 5^2 from the pattern

for divisible of 5
n = some number * 10 + last digit

n = some number * 100 + last two digits
last 2 digit must be divisible by 25
