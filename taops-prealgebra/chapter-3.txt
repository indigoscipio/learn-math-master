=====================================

Multiples
let A and B be numbers. we say that a is a multiple of b
if a = b . k where k is some integer
a is a multiple of b if there is an intege n such that a = bn

problem 3.1
a. both 147 and 357 are multiples of 7. is 147 + 357 a multiple of 7?
answer:
yes because 504 = 7 . n where n is 72

b. suppose k is a multiple of 7. must k + 7 be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 7 = 14 -> 14 is a multiple of 7 . n where n = 2 so 14 = 7 . 2 therfoer muliple of 7 

because k is a multiple of 7, there is an integer a such that k = 7a
adding 7 to k gives k + 7 = 7a + 7
k + 7 = 7(a + 1)
let b = a + 1.
k + 7 = 7b
since b is an integer, therefore k+7 is a multiple of 7

c. suppose r and s are multiples of 7. must r + s be a multiple of 7?
r = 7m
n = 7n
r + s = 7m + 7n
= 7(m+n)
since m+n is an integer, threfore 7(m+n) is also an integer
by definition of multiples, m+n is a multiple of 7

d. suppose k is a multiple of 7. is it possible for k+23 to be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 23 = 30 -> 30 is not a multiple of 7 since the reminder is not 0
therefore k+23 is not a multiple of 7

problem 3.2
what number between 100 and 200 is both a perfect square and a multiple of 7?
14*14 = 196
196 is a mulitple of 7 since 196 = 7 . 28
and a perfect square of 7 since 7^2 = 196

196 = 14 . 14 = 14 . 2 .7 = 28 . 7

problem 3.3
what is the greatest three digit number that is a multiple of 13?
answer:
start with 999 and check one by one
when dividing 999 / 13 we get quotient of 76 and reminder 11
988 = 76 . 13 -> therefore 988 is the answer

Problem 3.4
a. how many integers between 2 and 1004 are multiples of 5
b. how many integers between 150 and 300 are multiples of 9

a. lets tart with
1004 - 2 = 1002
5,10,15,...,1000
5(1,2,3,...,200)
therefore 200 multples of 5

b. 
multiples of 9 less than 300
9,18,27,...,297
= 9(1,2,...,33)

multiples of 9 less than 150
= 9(1,2,...,16)

therefore final result = 33 - 16 = 17

problem 3.5
a. must every multiple of 15 also be a multiple of 3?
answer: yes, because 15 has a common factor of 3 / divisible by 3
eg 30 = 3 . 10, 45 = 3 . 15, etc

b. must every multple of 3 also be a multiple of 15?
answer: no, counterexample:
6 is not a multipel of 15 because 6 is not divisble by 15

==============================================

if a and b are multiples of c
then a + b and a - c are also multiple of c

if we start with a multiple of n and add/subract a number
that is not a multiple of n, the nthe resulting sum/diff
is not a multple of n

if a is a multiple of b, then eevery multiple of a is also a multiple of b
transitivity of divisibility

exercises
3.1.1
what are the 10 smallest positive multiplesof 6?
answer:
6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,44,60

3.1.2
there are many positive two digit multiples of 7
but only two of these multiples have a digit sum  of 10
the digit sum of an integer is the sum of its digits.
what are these two multiples of 7?
answer
ok, so we ned to find two digit multiple of 7 that when summed the result is 10
28 and 91


3.1.3
what is the sum of all positive integer less than 100 that are multipeles of 13?
answer:
largest multiple of 13 less than 100 = 91 = 13 . 7
13(1+2+3+...+7)
= 13(28)
= 364

3.1.4
what is the least positive number that can be added to 173 so that
the result is a multiple of 20?
answer: we know 160 is the smaller multple 20 > 173
so 180 must be the largest
180 - 173 = 7 therefore 7

3.1.5
what is the smallest positive four digit multiple of 17?
1700 = 17 . 100
170 = 17 . 10
340 = 17 . 20
680 = 17 . 40

1700 - 680 = 1020
1020 - 17 = 1003

alternatively
1000 / 17 = 

3.1.6
what is the greatest four digit multiple of 18?
answer:
biggest four digit multiple of 18
18* 500 = 9000
18 * 25 = 450
18 * 25 = 450
18 * 5 = 90


18 * 500 + 18 * 25 + 18 * 25 + 18 * 5
= 9000 + 900 + 90
= 9990 

3.1.7
what is the greatest three digit multiple of 33
that can be written using three different digits?

answer:
ok so we know 990 is a multiple of 33 and the largest
but its digits are the same
next smallest = 990 - 33 = 957 -> different, therefore this is the largest


3.1.8
how many integers between 17 and 2678 are multiples of 11?
answer:
2 * 11 = 22 so this is the starting point 17 < n < 2678
we know 2678 / 11 is around 243 with some reminer, so 243 is the upper limit
so its 22, 33, 44 ... 2678 = 11(2,3,...,243)
now for the count: 243 - 2 + 1
= 242

===============

Divisibility tests

a is divisibile by b is a / b is an integer

problems
problem 3.6
a. note that
121212 = 120000 + 1200 + 12
how can we use this fact to tell that 121212 is divisible by 3?
answer:
RHS
= 3(40000) + 3(400) + 3(4)
= 3(40000+400+4) = 3(40404)
since 40404 is an integer, therefore its multiple/divisible by 3

b. how can we quickly tell  that 363637 is not divisible by 3?
answer:
363637 = 360000 + 3600 + 36 + 1
= 3(120000) + 3(1200) + 3(12) + 1
= 3(121212) + 1
since we have a reminder of 1 its not divisible by 3

problem 3.7
how can we tell at a glance a number is not a multiple of 10?
answer:
if the number is not divisble by 10, then the number i not a multiple of 10
or if the number leaves a reminder when dividing by 10
eg 13 / 10 = 1 with 3 reminder, therefore not divisble by 10

or generally, A number is not a multiple of 10 if
its last digit is any number other than 0.

problem 3.8
a. is every multiple of 10 is also a multiple of 5?
answer: 
10 = 5(2)
20 = 5(4)
how to prove generally?

a number is a multiple of 10 we can express as a = 10k where k is some integer
we want to shot if we can rewrite

a = 5 x (some integer)
since a = 10k, we can factor this into a = 5(2k)
since 2k is an integer, a is also an integer therefore
a is written as 5 times an integer. meaning a must be a multiple of 5


b. how can we tell at a glance wheter or not a number is a multiple of 5?
answer:

10 = 5 . 2
50 = 5 . 10
25 = 5 . 5
35 = 5 . 7
based on the pattern
we know that a number is a multiple of 5 if
the last digit ends with 5, or
the last digit ends with 0 (since number divisible by 10 also divisible by 5)


c. how can we tell at a glance wheter or not a number is a multiple of 2?
answer:
2 = 1 . 2
4 = 2 . 2
6 = 3 . 2

we know a number is a multiple of 2
if that number is even (2k) / divisibel by 2
and if the last digit is even (0,2,4,6,8)

problem 3.9
a. which of the following numbers are divisble by 4
12, 312, 512, 1512, 4312
answer: all of them are divisible by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number
formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

b. is every multiple of 100 also a multiple of 4?
answer:

100 = 4 (25)
200 = 8 (25) = 2 (4 . 25)
300 = 12 (25) = 3 (4 . 25)

yes because 100 = 25 . 4 which has 4 as a factor
general proof

a = 100k -> number is multiple of 100
we need to show if a can be written as a = 4 . some integer
a = 4 (25k)
therefore divisble by 4

c. use your answer to part b to expalin why 5,687,623,688 is divisible by 4
we need to show 5,687,623,688 = 4 . some integer

= 5,687,623,600 + 88
= 100 (56876236)
= 4 . 25 . 56876236 + 88
= 4 (25 . 56876236) + 4 (22)
= 4 ((25.56876236) + 22)
since ((25.56876236) + 22) is an integer and
since it can be written as 4 . some integer, therefore its dividible by 4

d. use your answer to part b to explain why 4,650,310 is not divisble by 4
we need to show 4,650,310  = 4 . some integer
4,650,310 = 4,650,300 + 10
= 100 (46503) + 10
= 4 . 25 . 46503 + 4 (2) + 2
= 4 ((25 . 46503) + 2) + 2
since this leave a reminder of 2 therefore it is not divible by 2

problem 3.10
in this problem, we disvoer a method for determining whether or not a number is divisble by 9
notice that 

765 = 7 . 100 + 6 . 10 + 5
= 7 (99 + 1) + 6 (9 + 1) + 5
= 7 . 99 + 7 + 4 . 9 + 6 + 5
= 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + (7 + 6 + 5)

a. as shown above, 765 = 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + (7 + 6 + 5)
notice that 7 + 6 + 5 is divisble by 9. explain why this tells us that 765 is divisible by 9
answer:
continuing from the answer,
= 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + 18
= (7 . 99) + (6 . 9) + (2 . 9)
= 9 (7 . 11 + 6 + 2)
= 9 (77 + 6 + 2)
= 9 (85)
since it can be written sa 9 . some integer where 85 is an integeger
therefore its divisble by 9

b. note that 8 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 18 explain why this tells us that 8154 is divisible by 9
answer: because 18/the total sum is divisible by 9

general proof
8154 = (8 . 1000) + (1 x 100) + (5 x 10) + 4
= (8 x (999 + 1)) + (1 x (99 + 1)) + (5 x (9 + 1)) + 4
= (8 x 999) + (8 x 1) + (99 + 1) + (45 + 5) + 4
= 9 ((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 ) + 8 + 4 + 1 + 5
((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 ) since this is guaranteed to be divisble by 9
the sum of digit is 8+4+1+5 = 18
and 18 is divisibel by 9
= 9 ((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 ) + (9 x 2)
= 9 ((8 x 111) + 11 + 5 + 2)

c. determine wheter or not 59814 is divisible by 9 without dividing 9 into 59814
answer: 59814 -> sum of digits = 5+9+8+1+4 = 27 / 9 = 3
so it is divisble by 9

problem 3.11
a. are both 99 and 9 divisible by 3?
answer:. yesm they are both divibsle by 3
since 99 / 3 = 33 with no reminder
and 9 / 3 / 3 with no reminder

b. is 765 divisibble by 3?
answer: is 765 divisble by 3?
yes becaues 765 = 255 . 3

c. is 67242 divisible by 3?
answer: yes because 67242 = 3. 22414

d. explain why 6148 is not divisble by 3 without dividing 6148 by 3
since 9 is a multiple of 3, we can aple previous sum of digit/ divisble by 9
6+1+4+8 = 19. since 19 is not divisble by 3, 6148 is not divisble by 3

problem 3.12
A is the units digit in the four digit number 4,63A
if 4,63A is divisble by 3 and by 4, then wat are the possible values of a?

answer:
number divisble by 4, last 2 digit must be divisble by 4
32
36

then filter again, number divisble by 3
the sum of its digits must be divisble by 9

sum = 4+6+3+a = 13 + a
case 1: A = 2 -> 4+6+3+2 = 15 -> divisible by 3
case 2: A = 6 -> 4+6+3+6 = 19 -> not divisble by 3
therefore the only possible value for A is 2

problem 3.13
N is the tens digit in the five digit number 24,6N8
If 24,6N8 is divisible by 9, then must 24,6N8 also be divisible by 4?

answer:
24,6N8 is divisible by 9 -> this means the sum of digits must be divisble by 9
find possible values that saisfies this
sum = 2 + 4 + 6 + n + 8 = 20 + n
n = 7 -> 20 + 7 = 27

next check if its divisble by 4
24678 -> last two digit = 78
is 78 divisble by 4? its not divisble by 4

It only needs to be divisible by 4 if the last two digits, 78, were divisible by 4.

=====================
a number is divisible by, if
2 -> must be even
3 -> sum of digits must be multiple of 3
4 -> last d digit is multiple of 4
5 -> last digit is either 0 or 5
9 -> sum of digits is multiple of 9
10 -> last digit is 0



3.2.1
which of the following id divisible by 5
46,624
560,335
60,231,060
9,671,118

answer:
to find a number is dibisble by 5, the lat digit must be either 5 or 0,
so 560,335 and 60,231,060 are both divisible by 5

3.2.2
which of the following numbers are divisble by 4
46,624
560,335
60,231,060
9,671,118
answer:
last 2 digit must be divible by 4
46,624 -> 24 is divisble by 4 ✅
560,335 -> 35 is not divisble by 4 ❌
60,231,060 -> 60 is divisble by 4 ✅
9,671,118 -> 18 is not divisble by 4 ❌

3.2.3

which of the following numbers are not divisble by 7
7,000,014
14,035
7,777,728
42,721,034
49,763
answer:
7,000,014 = 7 . 1000000 + 14 = 7 . 1000000 + 7 . 2 = 7(1000000.2) ✅
14,035 = 7 . 2000 + 7 . 5 = 7 (2000+5) ✅
7,777,728 = 7 . 1111100 + 7 . 4 = 7 (1111104) ✅

therefore 42,721,034

3.2.5
how many numbers from 1 - 400 have a 2 in the units place (ones placee)
and are divisble by 4?
answer:
we know that a number is divisble by 4 if the last 2 digit is also divisble by 4
so we need to find last 2 digit divisble by 4 and the last digit is 2
from 1 - 100 -> 12, 32, 52, 72, 92 = 5 numbers
from 1 - 400 -> 4 x 5 = 20 numbesr

3.2.6
both ABC and 3D8 are 3 digit numbers such that
ABC - 3D8 = 269
if 3D8 is divisble by 9, then what number does ABC represent?
answer:

divisble by 9 -> sum of digit must be divisble by 9
3D8 = 3 + d + 8 = 11 + d
we must find d such that 11 + d is divisble by 9
d = 7 -> 11 + 7 = 18
3D8 = 378

ABC - 378 = 269
ABC = 269 + 378
ABC = 647

3.2.7
what is the largest idgit d for which the number 214,d07 is divisble by 3?
answer:
divisble by 3 mens the sum of digit must also digvisble by 3
214d07 = 2+1+4+d+0+7 = 14 + d
9 -> largest but not divisble by 3
8 doesn't work also
threfore 7 is the largest idgit since 14 + 7 = 21

3.2.8
consider the rules we found to test for divisibility by 2 and 4
can you find a similar rule for divisible by 8?
answer:
we know if number is divisble by 2, the number must be even

we know if number is divisble by 4, last 2 digit must be divisble by 4
516 = 500 + 16 = 5 . (4 . 25) + 4 (4) = 4 (5 . 25) + 4(4) = 4 (125+4) = 4(129)

then for a number divibsle by 4 it must be find the smallest power of 10
that is guaranteed ot be multiple of 8
416 = 8 (50) + 8 (2) = 8 (52)
54320 = 5400 + 320 = (54 . (8 . 125)) . (8 . 40) = 8(54 . 125) . 8(40) = 8(54.125 + 40)

A number is divisible by 8 if and only if the number
formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.


to test a number is divisble by 2, we need
10 = (2 . 5) -> 2 (5)
100 = 4 . 25
1000 = 8 . 125

============================================
Prime Numbers
A prime number is a positive integer that is divisble by exactly 2 positive integers
1 and the number itself

a composite number is a positive integer that is divisibly by
more than 2 positive integers.
this means tat a number is composite if it is divisble by some positive integer
besides 1 and the number itself

answer: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

3.15

Meena is trying to determine whether or not 113 is prime.
She's doing so by checking 113 for divisibility by each positive integer starting with 2.
She sees that 113 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
She then checks if 113 is divisible by 3. Since 1+1+3= 5 is not divisible by 3,
she knows that 113 is not divisible by 3.
(a) Meena says, "Since 113 is not divisible by 2,
I know that 113 isn't divisible by 4." Is she right? Why or why not?
answer:
her answer is correct 
to check if a number is divisble by 4 the last 2 digit must be divisble by 4
113 -> 13 is not divisble by 4, therefore its not divisbe
If a number fails the test for 2, it's impossible for it to pass the test for 4.

(b) How does Meena know at a glance that 113 is not divisible by 5?
answer: because the last digit is not either 0 or 5

(c) She then says, "Since 113 is not divisible by 2,
I know that it isn't divisible by 6." Is she right? Why or why not?
answer: correct because 6 has a factor of 2
any number divisble by 6 is also divisble by 2

(d) Meena divides 113 by 7 and finds a remainder of 1,
so she knows that 113 is not divisible by 7. She then says,
"I don't have to test 8, 9, or 10. I know that 113 isn't divisible by 
ny of those." How does she know without testing?
8 -> since we testd ealrier the number is not divisble by 2, therefore its not divisble by 8
9 -> sum of digit we tested earlier, its not divisble by 3, therefore not divisbel by 9
and 10 -> we tested earlier number is not divisble by5, therefore not idvisble by 10

(e) Meena then says, "Since 11^2 is 121, I don't have to test any numbers
higher than 10. I now know that 113 is prime." Why doesn't Meena have to test any
more numbers?

====================================

if a number is not divisble by a prime,
then it is not divisble by any multiple of that prime
to check for primarlity
we only need to test if that number is divisble by prime numbers

to check if a number is prime,
we only need to test if it is divisble by primes
whose squares are less than or equal to the number we are testing

therefore 71,73,79

3.3.3
what is the largest prime number p such that 8 times p is less than 1000?
answer:
8 . p = 1000
p = 125
which means we need to find prime number p less than 125
113

3.3.4
how many pairs of primes are there such that the sum of pair is 40?
largest prime least than 40 =
37 and 3
29 + 11
17 + 23

3.3.5
a. the product of all prime numbers between 1 and 80 is divided by 10
what is the remiander?
answer: 
(2*3*5*7*...*79) / 10
we know that  (2*3*5*7*...*79) is a prime
and since theres 2 and 5 there we can rewrite it as
(/ * 5) (3 * 7 * .. * 79)
p = 10 * all other prime factors
therefore the reminder is 0

b. the product of all prime numbers between 1 and 80 is divided by 4
what is the reminder?
answer:
(2*3*5*7*...*79) / 4
since the only even number in prime is 2,
and it contains only one factor of 2

p = 2 . (product of all odd primes)
(3 * 5 * 7 * ... * 79) / 2
therefore the reminder is 2

3.3.6
how many groups of three prime numbers add to 22?
note 2,3,5 add up
