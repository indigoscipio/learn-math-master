=====================================

Multiples
let A and B be numbers. we say that a is a multiple of b
if a = b . k where k is some integer
a is a multiple of b if there is an intege n such that a = bn

problem 3.1
a. both 147 and 357 are multiples of 7. is 147 + 357 a multiple of 7?
answer:
yes because 504 = 7 . n where n is 72

b. suppose k is a multiple of 7. must k + 7 be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 7 = 14 -> 14 is a multiple of 7 . n where n = 2 so 14 = 7 . 2 therfoer muliple of 7 

because k is a multiple of 7, there is an integer a such that k = 7a
adding 7 to k gives k + 7 = 7a + 7
k + 7 = 7(a + 1)
let b = a + 1.
k + 7 = 7b
since b is an integer, therefore k+7 is a multiple of 7

c. suppose r and s are multiples of 7. must r + s be a multiple of 7?
r = 7m
n = 7n
r + s = 7m + 7n
= 7(m+n)
since m+n is an integer, threfore 7(m+n) is also an integer
by definition of multiples, m+n is a multiple of 7

d. suppose k is a multiple of 7. is it possible for k+23 to be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 23 = 30 -> 30 is not a multiple of 7 since the reminder is not 0
therefore k+23 is not a multiple of 7

problem 3.2
what number between 100 and 200 is both a perfect square and a multiple of 7?
14*14 = 196
196 is a mulitple of 7 since 196 = 7 . 28
and a perfect square of 7 since 7^2 = 196

196 = 14 . 14 = 14 . 2 .7 = 28 . 7

problem 3.3
what is the greatest three digit number that is a multiple of 13?
answer:
start with 999 and check one by one
when dividing 999 / 13 we get quotient of 76 and reminder 11
988 = 76 . 13 -> therefore 988 is the answer

Problem 3.4
a. how many integers between 2 and 1004 are multiples of 5
b. how many integers between 150 and 300 are multiples of 9

a. lets tart with
1004 - 2 = 1002
5,10,15,...,1000
5(1,2,3,...,200)
therefore 200 multples of 5

b. 
multiples of 9 less than 300
9,18,27,...,297
= 9(1,2,...,33)

multiples of 9 less than 150
= 9(1,2,...,16)

therefore final result = 33 - 16 = 17

problem 3.5
a. must every multiple of 15 also be a multiple of 3?
answer: yes, because 15 has a common factor of 3 / divisible by 3
eg 30 = 3 . 10, 45 = 3 . 15, etc

b. must every multple of 3 also be a multiple of 15?
answer: no, counterexample:
6 is not a multipel of 15 because 6 is not divisble by 15

==============================================

if a and b are multiples of c
then a + b and a - c are also multiple of c

if we start with a multiple of n and add/subract a number
that is not a multiple of n, the nthe resulting sum/diff
is not a multple of n

if a is a multiple of b, then eevery multiple of a is also a multiple of b
transitivity of divisibility
