=====================================

Multiples
let A and B be numbers. we say that a is a multiple of b
if a = b . k where k is some integer
a is a multiple of b if there is an intege n such that a = bn

problem 3.1
a. both 147 and 357 are multiples of 7. is 147 + 357 a multiple of 7?
answer:
yes because 504 = 7 . n where n is 72

b. suppose k is a multiple of 7. must k + 7 be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 7 = 14 -> 14 is a multiple of 7 . n where n = 2 so 14 = 7 . 2 therfoer muliple of 7 

because k is a multiple of 7, there is an integer a such that k = 7a
adding 7 to k gives k + 7 = 7a + 7
k + 7 = 7(a + 1)
let b = a + 1.
k + 7 = 7b
since b is an integer, therefore k+7 is a multiple of 7

c. suppose r and s are multiples of 7. must r + s be a multiple of 7?
r = 7m
n = 7n
r + s = 7m + 7n
= 7(m+n)
since m+n is an integer, threfore 7(m+n) is also an integer
by definition of multiples, m+n is a multiple of 7

d. suppose k is a multiple of 7. is it possible for k+23 to be a multiple of 7?
answer:
let k = 7
7 + 23 = 30 -> 30 is not a multiple of 7 since the reminder is not 0
therefore k+23 is not a multiple of 7

problem 3.2
what number between 100 and 200 is both a perfect square and a multiple of 7?
14*14 = 196
196 is a mulitple of 7 since 196 = 7 . 28
and a perfect square of 7 since 7^2 = 196

196 = 14 . 14 = 14 . 2 .7 = 28 . 7

problem 3.3
what is the greatest three digit number that is a multiple of 13?
answer:
start with 999 and check one by one
when dividing 999 / 13 we get quotient of 76 and reminder 11
988 = 76 . 13 -> therefore 988 is the answer

Problem 3.4
a. how many integers between 2 and 1004 are multiples of 5
b. how many integers between 150 and 300 are multiples of 9

a. lets tart with
1004 - 2 = 1002
5,10,15,...,1000
5(1,2,3,...,200)
therefore 200 multples of 5

b. 
multiples of 9 less than 300
9,18,27,...,297
= 9(1,2,...,33)

multiples of 9 less than 150
= 9(1,2,...,16)

therefore final result = 33 - 16 = 17

problem 3.5
a. must every multiple of 15 also be a multiple of 3?
answer: yes, because 15 has a common factor of 3 / divisible by 3
eg 30 = 3 . 10, 45 = 3 . 15, etc

b. must every multple of 3 also be a multiple of 15?
answer: no, counterexample:
6 is not a multipel of 15 because 6 is not divisble by 15

==============================================

if a and b are multiples of c
then a + b and a - c are also multiple of c

if we start with a multiple of n and add/subract a number
that is not a multiple of n, the nthe resulting sum/diff
is not a multple of n

if a is a multiple of b, then eevery multiple of a is also a multiple of b
transitivity of divisibility

exercises
3.1.1
what are the 10 smallest positive multiplesof 6?
answer:
6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,44,60

3.1.2
there are many positive two digit multiples of 7
but only two of these multiples have a digit sum  of 10
the digit sum of an integer is the sum of its digits.
what are these two multiples of 7?
answer
ok, so we ned to find two digit multiple of 7 that when summed the result is 10
28 and 91


3.1.3
what is the sum of all positive integer less than 100 that are multipeles of 13?
answer:
largest multiple of 13 less than 100 = 91 = 13 . 7
13(1+2+3+...+7)
= 13(28)
= 364

3.1.4
what is the least positive number that can be added to 173 so that
the result is a multiple of 20?
answer: we know 160 is the smaller multple 20 > 173
so 180 must be the largest
180 - 173 = 7 therefore 7

3.1.5
what is the smallest positive four digit multiple of 17?
1700 = 17 . 100
170 = 17 . 10
340 = 17 . 20
680 = 17 . 40

1700 - 680 = 1020
1020 - 17 = 1003

alternatively
1000 / 17 = 

3.1.6
what is the greatest four digit multiple of 18?
answer:
biggest four digit multiple of 18
18* 500 = 9000
18 * 25 = 450
18 * 25 = 450
18 * 5 = 90


18 * 500 + 18 * 25 + 18 * 25 + 18 * 5
= 9000 + 900 + 90
= 9990 

3.1.7
what is the greatest three digit multiple of 33
that can be written using three different digits?

answer:
ok so we know 990 is a multiple of 33 and the largest
but its digits are the same
next smallest = 990 - 33 = 957 -> different, therefore this is the largest


3.1.8
how many integers between 17 and 2678 are multiples of 11?
answer:
2 * 11 = 22 so this is the starting point 17 < n < 2678
we know 2678 / 11 is around 243 with some reminer, so 243 is the upper limit
so its 22, 33, 44 ... 2678 = 11(2,3,...,243)
now for the count: 243 - 2 + 1
= 242

===============

Divisibility tests

a is divisibile by b is a / b is an integer

problems
problem 3.6
a. note that
121212 = 120000 + 1200 + 12
how can we use this fact to tell that 121212 is divisible by 3?
answer:
RHS
= 3(40000) + 3(400) + 3(4)
= 3(40000+400+4) = 3(40404)
since 40404 is an integer, therefore its multiple/divisible by 3

b. how can we quickly tell  that 363637 is not divisible by 3?
answer:
363637 = 360000 + 3600 + 36 + 1
= 3(120000) + 3(1200) + 3(12) + 1
= 3(121212) + 1
since we have a reminder of 1 its not divisible by 3

problem 3.7
how can we tell at a glance a number is not a multiple of 10?
answer:
if the number is not divisble by 10, then the number i not a multiple of 10
or if the number leaves a reminder when dividing by 10
eg 13 / 10 = 1 with 3 reminder, therefore not divisble by 10

or generally, A number is not a multiple of 10 if
its last digit is any number other than 0.

problem 3.8
a. is every multiple of 10 is also a multiple of 5?
answer: 
10 = 5(2)
20 = 5(4)
how to prove generally?

a number is a multiple of 10 we can express as a = 10k where k is some integer
we want to shot if we can rewrite

a = 5 x (some integer)
since a = 10k, we can factor this into a = 5(2k)
since 2k is an integer, a is also an integer therefore
a is written as 5 times an integer. meaning a must be a multiple of 5


b. how can we tell at a glance wheter or not a number is a multiple of 5?
answer:

10 = 5 . 2
50 = 5 . 10
25 = 5 . 5
35 = 5 . 7
based on the pattern
we know that a number is a multiple of 5 if
the last digit ends with 5, or
the last digit ends with 0 (since number divisible by 10 also divisible by 5)


c. how can we tell at a glance wheter or not a number is a multiple of 2?
answer:
2 = 1 . 2
4 = 2 . 2
6 = 3 . 2

we know a number is a multiple of 2
if that number is even (2k) / divisibel by 2
and if the last digit is even (0,2,4,6,8)

problem 3.9
a. which of the following numbers are divisble by 4
12, 312, 512, 1512, 4312
answer: all of them are divisible by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number
formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

b. is every multiple of 100 also a multiple of 4?
answer:

100 = 4 (25)
200 = 8 (25) = 2 (4 . 25)
300 = 12 (25) = 3 (4 . 25)

yes because 100 = 25 . 4 which has 4 as a factor
general proof

a = 100k -> number is multiple of 100
we need to show if a can be written as a = 4 . some integer
a = 4 (25k)
therefore divisble by 4

c. use your answer to part b to expalin why 5,687,623,688 is divisible by 4
we need to show 5,687,623,688 = 4 . some integer

= 5,687,623,600 + 88
= 100 (56876236)
= 4 . 25 . 56876236 + 88
= 4 (25 . 56876236) + 4 (22)
= 4 ((25.56876236) + 22)
since ((25.56876236) + 22) is an integer and
since it can be written as 4 . some integer, therefore its dividible by 4

d. use your answer to part b to explain why 4,650,310 is not divisble by 4
we need to show 4,650,310  = 4 . some integer
4,650,310 = 4,650,300 + 10
= 100 (46503) + 10
= 4 . 25 . 46503 + 4 (2) + 2
= 4 ((25 . 46503) + 2) + 2
since this leave a reminder of 2 therefore it is not divible by 2

problem 3.10
in this problem, we disvoer a method for determining whether or not a number is divisble by 9
notice that 

765 = 7 . 100 + 6 . 10 + 5
= 7 (99 + 1) + 6 (9 + 1) + 5
= 7 . 99 + 7 + 4 . 9 + 6 + 5
= 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + (7 + 6 + 5)

a. as shown above, 765 = 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + (7 + 6 + 5)
notice that 7 + 6 + 5 is divisble by 9. explain why this tells us that 765 is divisible by 9
answer:
continuing from the answer,
= 7 . 99 + 6 . 9 + 18
= (7 . 99) + (6 . 9) + (2 . 9)
= 9 (7 . 11 + 6 + 2)
= 9 (77 + 6 + 2)
= 9 (85)
since it can be written sa 9 . some integer where 85 is an integeger
therefore its divisble by 9
