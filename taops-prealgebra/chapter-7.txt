my aunt candy jar has 56 pieces of candy
she only has butterscotch and jelly beans and the ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans
is 5:2 i like jelly beans more and i want to add some jelly beans os that the ratio
of butterscotch to jelly beans is 2:1 how many jellyb eans shold i ad?

answer:
total = 56
b:j = 5 : 2
total part = 7
value pr part = 56/7 = 8

with the 5:2 ratio we have
butterscotch: 5/7 . 56 = 40
jellybeans: 2/7 . 56 = 16

if wewanna change the ratio
keep butterscotch at 40
and since 2:1 = 40:20

calc the diff -> 20 - 16 = 4 jellybans
add 4 more jellybeans, keep the butterstoch the same

method1: variable/value per part
5n + 2n = 56
7n = 56
n = 56/7
n = 8
then find how much each part is

method2: the sum of the whole

black : brown = 2 : 1
white : red = 4 : 1

we wanna find ratio white : black
brown : red = 3 : 1
black : brown = 6 : 3 - mult by 3

now ratio of brown : red : black is
3 : 1 : 6

next do the same for white : red, find common ratio and multiply to "fit"
since red already 1 just pair it

so brown : red : black : white is
3 : 1 : 6 : 4

the ratio of white to black is
4 : 6
2 : 3

a recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of flour and 4 eggs
if ionly 3 eggs are used then  how many cups of flour should be used
answer:
find the ratio first
flour : eggs = 5/2 : 4
5/2 : 8/2 = 5 : 8

if we use 3 eggs we wanna find the ratio for flour
5/8 = x/3

mult both sides by 3
3 . 5/8 = x
15/8 = x
x = 1 7/8
therefore we will need 1 7/8 cups of flour

sadie is 3 feet tall and
at 6pm in sunnytawn sadie casts an 8 foot shadow
nick is 5 feet tall. how long is his shadow at 6pm in sunnytown?

answer:
we know the ratio of height sadie : nick is 3 : 5
we wanna find the shadow ratio but we only know sadie's shadow

3 : 5 =  8 : x
3/5 = 8/x
mult both sides by x
3/5 .x = 8/x . x
3/5x = 8
mult both by 5/3
3/5x . 5/3 =  8 . 5/3
x = 40/3
x = 13 1/3

so his length is 13 1/3 feet 

alternatively
since w know sadies shadow is 8/3 times as long as her height
shadow : height = 8/3, therefore the shadow is 8/3 times the height
then nicks shadow must also be 8/3 times as long as his height
5 . 8/3 = 40/3

alternatively
5/x = 3/8

problem 7.14
my map of upstate new york has the scale 1/4 inch = 5 miles

answer:
we konw the  ratio to building : window = 30 : 8 = 15 : 4

now the new value for building is now 8 inches
we need to find the building value

since we know
building : window
15 : 4
8 : x

15/4 = 8/x
mult by 4x
15x = 32
x = 32/15
= 2 2/15 inches

alternatiely
since we know the  window is 4/15 of the building,
just multiply 4/15 . 8 = 32/15

my wallet size photo of my pet cat snookums is 3cm wide and 5cm tall
if i want larger photo to put on my wall and i want the are aof the photo ot be 135 square cm
then how many cm wide should the larger photo be?

answer:

width : height = 3 : 5
and we have a new total area = 135cm^2
to find rectangle area = width * height

old area = 3 x 5 = 15cm^2
factors of 135 = 3 . 3 . 3 . 5
therefore the new ratio w:H should be 
9 : 15 = 135 total
so the new width tshould be 9cm
