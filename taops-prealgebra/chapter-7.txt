RATIOS

7.1
simplify folowing ratio
a. 2 : 10
b. 9 : 6
c. 1/2 : 1/3
d. 2 1/3 : 1 4/9
e. 1.4 : 2.4

a. 1:5
b. 3:2
c. 3 : 2
d. 7/3 : 13/9 = 21 : 13
e. 14/10 : 24/10 = 14:24 = 7:12


7.2
the ratio of cats to dogs in pet shop is 2:5
if there are 25 dogs in the shop how many cats are there

answer:
1/5 . 25 = 5
2/5 . 25 = 10 so cats = 10



7.3
mrs millers class has a ratio of girls to boys of 4 : 3
if there are 35 students how many of them are girls

35/7=5
4.5 = 20
3.5 = 15

4 : 7 = g : 35
mult by 5
20 : 35 = g : 35


7.4
a 10 foot length of rope is cut into two pieces whose lengths are the ratio 1:4
what is the length of thelonger piece?

total part = 1 + 4 = 5
10/5 = 2 values per part

10 . 1/5 = 2 foot
10 . 4/5 = 8 foot

the longer one is the 8 foot

7.5
my aunt candy jar has 56 pieces of candy
she only has butterscotch and jelly beans and the ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans
is 5:2 i like jelly beans more and i want to add some jelly beans os that the ratio
of butterscotch to jelly beans is 2:1 how many jellyb eans shold i ad?

answer:
total = 56
b:j = 5 : 2
total part = 7
value pr part = 56/7 = 8

with the 5:2 ratio we have
butterscotch: 5/7 . 56 = 40
jellybeans: 2/7 . 56 = 16

if wewanna change the ratio
keep butterscotch at 40
and since 2:1 = 40:20

calc the diff -> 20 - 16 = 4 jellybans
add 4 more jellybeans, keep the butterstoch the same

method1: variable/value per part
5n + 2n = 56
7n = 56
n = 56/7
n = 8
then find how much each part is

method2: the sum of the whole
