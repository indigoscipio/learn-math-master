a. 2 : 10
b. 9 : 6
c. 1/2 : 1/3
d. 2 1/3 : 1 4/9
e. 1.4 : 2.4

a. 1:5
b. 3:2
c. 3 : 2
d. 7/3 : 13/9 = 21 : 13
e. 14/10 : 24/10 = 14:24 = 7:12


7.2
the ratio of cats to dogs in pet shop is 2:5
if there are 25 dogs in the shop how many cats are there

answer:
1/5 . 25 = 5
2/5 . 25 = 10 so cats = 10



7.3
mrs millers class has a ratio of girls to boys of 4 : 3
if there are 35 students how many of them are girls

35/7=5
4.5 = 20
3.5 = 15

4 : 7 = g : 35
mult by 5
20 : 35 = g : 35


7.4
a 10 foot length of rope is cut into two pieces whose lengths are the ratio 1:4
what is the length of thelonger piece?

total part = 1 + 4 = 5
10/5 = 2 values per part

10 . 1/5 = 2 foot
10 . 4/5 = 8 foot

the longer one is the 8 foot

7.5
my aunt candy jar has 56 pieces of candy
she only has butterscotch and jelly beans and the ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans
is 5:2 i like jelly beans more and i want to add some jelly beans os that the ratio
of butterscotch to jelly beans is 2:1 how many jellyb eans shold i ad?

answer:
total = 56
b:j = 5 : 2
total part = 7
value pr part = 56/7 = 8

with the 5:2 ratio we have
butterscotch: 5/7 . 56 = 40
jellybeans: 2/7 . 56 = 16

if wewanna change the ratio
keep butterscotch at 40
and since 2:1 = 40:20

calc the diff -> 20 - 16 = 4 jellybans
add 4 more jellybeans, keep the butterstoch the same

method1: variable/value per part
5n + 2n = 56
7n = 56
n = 56/7
n = 8
then find how much each part is

method2: the sum of the whole

the ratio of girls to boys participagin in intramural volleyball of ashland middle school is 
7 to 4. there are 42 girls in the program. what is the total number of participants?

answer:
42 : 7 = 6 girls per 1 ratio

7 . 6 : 4 . 6

; ===========================================

7.1.5
two numbers are in the ratio 3 : 8
their sum if 44. what is greater of the two numbers?

total part = 11
1st -> 3 / 11 . 44 = 12
2nd -> 8 / 11 . 44 = 32

the greater is 32

alternative
find the value per part
3n + 8n = 44
11n= 44
n = 4

8n = 8 . 4 = 32

7.1.6
an 8inch long sub sandwich is cut into 2 pieces whose length
is ratio of 7 to 5
how lng is the shorter piece?

answer
total part = 12
shorter piece = 5/12 . 8 = 40/12 = 10/3 = 3 1/3 inches

alternative find the value per part
7n + 5n = 8
12n = 8
n = 8/12 = 2/3
5 . 2/3 = 10/3 = 1/3 inches


7.17
a father left 280 acre of land to be divided among his sons al and bob in the ratio
4 : 3 respectively. how many acres should al receive?

answer:
so total acreis 280

find value per part
4n + 3n = 280
7n = 280
n = 40

multipply
4 . 40 = 160 acres

alternatiely
4/7 . 280 = 4 . 40 = 160

7.1.8
two postive numbers are in the ratio of 4:9
their difference is 30
what is the sum mof the two numbers

answer:
9n - 4n = 30
5n = 30
n = 6

4.6 + 9.6
24 + 54
78

7.1.9
the ratio of teachers to students in particular school is 1 : 11
the ratio of female students to total number of students is 4 : 9
ifthere are 396 female students how many teachers are there

answer:
find value/part blocks
396 : 4 = 99 blocks


total student  = 9.99 = 891
4/9 . 891

now calc the teacher
since we know in 1 : 11 the 11 represents 891 just divideit by 11
so the totalteacher is 81


7.1.10
the ratio of losses to wins for kyle team is 3 : 2
if hte team had played the same num of games but had won
twice as many of its games, then what should the ratio of losses to wins have been?
hint: use variable to write expr for how many games kyles team won and lost

answer:
games kyles team won: 1:4


7.1.11
the ratio of pennies to dimes in a jar is 2 : 5
and there are a total of 245 pennies and dimes in the jar
how many pennies should be added to make ratio of pennies to dimes be 3 : 7

answr:
total parts = 7
find the blocks
pennies = 2/7 . 245 = 70
dimes = 5/7 . 245 = 175

since we just wanna add the penny freeze the dime count
something : 175 should be 3 : 7

find the base block count -> 175 : 7 = 25
therefore the total count should be  75 : 175

in other words the difference = 75 - 70 = 5
just add 5 more penny

problem 7.6
simplify the folowing ratios
a. 5 : 15 : 10
b. 6 : 10 : 9
c. 8 : 32 : 4 : 8
d. 1/2 : 1/3 : 2/3
e. 3 1/3 : 4 1/4 : 5 1/5

a. common factors is 5
1 : 3 : 2

b. no common factor, so 
6 : 10 : 9

c. comon factor is 4
2 : 8 : 1 : 2

d. mult by 6
1/2 . 6 : 1/3 . 6 : 2/3 . 6
3 : 2 : 4

e. 10/3 : 17/4 : 26/5
lcm = 60
10/3 . 60 : 17/4 . 60 : 26/5 . 60

 a bowling tournamesnt pays out prizes to top 3 players in ratio 5:2:1
 if total prize money is $1000 then how much the first place winner receive

answer

 highest - 5
 5/8 . 1000 = 5.125 = $625


7.8
sam wants to bake a cake that requires butter flour sugar and milk in ratio
1 : 6 : 2 : 1. sam has 1/2 cup of sugar
how much of the other ingredients does he need?

answer
find value per part
since sugar has 2 ratio and the value is 1/2
1 ratio is 1/2 : 2 = 1/2 . 1/2 = 1/4

so remaining ingredient is
1 . 1/4 : 6 . 1/4 : 2 . 1/4 : 1 . 1/4
1/4 : 3/2 : 1/2 : 1/4

method 2
alternatively, try solving two ratios one by one by eliminating

method 3:
use "parts of the whole"
sugar is 2/10 = 1/5 of the total
total quantity is 1/2 : 1/5 = 5/2 cups of the total ingredient quantity




7.9
jamal needs 3 galons of a mix that is two parts blue paint
three parts white pant
and one part red paint

how many galoons of red paint will he need?

answer:
so the total is 3 galons
and the multiratio of blue : white : red is
2 : 3 : 1

total part = 2+3+1 = 6
to find red just do
1/6 . 3 = 1/2 galons

problem 7.10
i have blots bleets and blits in a bag
the ratio of the number of blots to bleets is 3 : 4

the ratio of bleets to the number of blits is 5 : 6
what is the ratio of the number of blots to the numbero f blits?

answer:
so we have
blots : bleets : blits = ? : ? : ?

but we know
blots : bleets = 3 : 4
bleets : blits = 5 : 6

mult until bleets has the same num
mult by 5 -> blots : bleets = 3 : 4 = 15 : 20
mult by 4 -> bleets : blits = 5 : 6 = 20 : 24

simplify - cannot be further
so the final ratio 15 : 20 : 24

ratio to blots : blits =
15 : 24 = 5 : 8

Exercise
7.2.1
a long whose length is 60 inches is cut into 3 pieces in ratio
1 : 3 : 5
whats the numer of inches inthe length of the shortest piece

answer
since we know the total is 60 use parts of whole
total parts = 1+3+5 = 9
the shortest is 1/9 . 60 = 60/9 = 20/3 = 6 2/3 inches

7.2.2
three numbers have ratio 1 : 2 : 3 and their sum is 48

3 friends akira bruono camera ppoled their money to start lemonade stand
akira: contributed $25
bruno: contributed $20
carmela: contributed $35

after a month their lemonade stand earnedd $2000
they wanna distribute this money in the same ratio as the money was invested
how many collars will bruno received

answer:
ok so initial investment
a : b : c = 25 : 20 : 35
a : b : c = 5 : 4 : 7

now we know total income $2000
since b has 4 ratio and total part = 5+4+7=16
4/16 . 2000
1/4 . 2000 = 500

7.2.5
the top four winners ina golf tournament share the prize money in the ratio
9:5:2:1
if the top prize winner receive $45000 then how much prize money was awarded in total?

answer:
since we know the 9 ratio has 45000
just divide it by 9 to find how much each 1 block is valued

45000/9 = $5000

so the total prize money = 9+5+2+1= 17 . 5000 = $85000

or alternatively
ratio of top winner : total = 9 : 17
multiply by 5000 to match 45000
45000 : 85000

7.2.6
