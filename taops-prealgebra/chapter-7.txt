e. 1.4 : 2.4

a. 1:5
b. 3:2
c. 3 : 2
d. 7/3 : 13/9 = 21 : 13
e. 14/10 : 24/10 = 14:24 = 7:12


7.2
the ratio of cats to dogs in pet shop is 2:5
if there are 25 dogs in the shop how many cats are there

answer:
1/5 . 25 = 5
2/5 . 25 = 10 so cats = 10



7.3
mrs millers class has a ratio of girls to boys of 4 : 3
if there are 35 students how many of them are girls

35/7=5
4.5 = 20
3.5 = 15

4 : 7 = g : 35
mult by 5
20 : 35 = g : 35


7.4
a 10 foot length of rope is cut into two pieces whose lengths are the ratio 1:4
what is the length of thelonger piece?

total part = 1 + 4 = 5
10/5 = 2 values per part

10 . 1/5 = 2 foot
10 . 4/5 = 8 foot

the longer one is the 8 foot

7.5
my aunt candy jar has 56 pieces of candy
she only has butterscotch and jelly beans and the ratio of butterscotch to jelly beans
is 5:2 i like jelly beans more and i want to add some jelly beans os that the ratio
of butterscotch to jelly beans is 2:1 how many jellyb eans shold i ad?

answer:
total = 56
b:j = 5 : 2
total part = 7
value pr part = 56/7 = 8

with the 5:2 ratio we have
butterscotch: 5/7 . 56 = 40
jellybeans: 2/7 . 56 = 16

if wewanna change the ratio
keep butterscotch at 40
and since 2:1 = 40:20

calc the diff -> 20 - 16 = 4 jellybans
add 4 more jellybeans, keep the butterstoch the same

method1: variable/value per part
5n + 2n = 56
7n = 56
n = 56/7
n = 8
then find how much each part is

method2: the sum of the whole

h. 672 : 0
672 / 672 : 0 / 672
1 : 0

7.1.2
there are 10 boys in a class of 25 students whats the ratio of girls to boys?
answer:

let x be boys and y be girls
values
boys = 10
girls = 25 - 10 = 15

the ratio of boys to girls = 10 : 15
2 : 3


7.13.
gear a makes 2 revolutions for every 5 revolutions gear b makes
if gear a makes 36 revolutions in 1 minute then 
how many revolutions does gear b make in 1 minutes?

answer:

ratio is
2 : 5

36 : b
36 : 36 * 2 + 18
36 : 90
gear b makes 90

7.1.4
the ratio of girls to boys participagin in intramural volleyball of ashland middle school is 
7 to 4. there are 42 girls in the program. what is the total number of participants?

answer:
42 : 7 = 6 girls per 1 ratio

7 . 6 : 4 . 6
42 : 24

total participants = 42 + 24 = 66

; ===========================================

7.1.5
two numbers are in the ratio 3 : 8
their sum if 44. what is greater of the two numbers?

total part = 11
1st -> 3 / 11 . 44 = 12
2nd -> 8 / 11 . 44 = 32

the greater is 32

alternative
find the value per part
3n + 8n = 44
11n= 44
n = 4

8n = 8 . 4 = 32

7.1.6
an 8inch long sub sandwich is cut into 2 pieces whose length
is ratio of 7 to 5
how lng is the shorter piece?

answer
total part = 12
shorter piece = 5/12 . 8 = 40/12 = 10/3 = 3 1/3 inches

alternative find the value per part
7n + 5n = 8
12n = 8
n = 8/12 = 2/3
5 . 2/3 = 10/3 = 1/3 inches


7.17
a father left 280 acre of land to be divided among his sons al and bob in the ratio
4 : 3 respectively. how many acres should al receive?

answer:
so total acreis 280

find value per part
4n + 3n = 280
7n = 280
n = 40

multipply
4 . 40 = 160 acres

alternatiely
4/7 . 280 = 4 . 40 = 160

7.1.8
two postive numbers are in the ratio of 4:9
their difference is 30
what is the sum mof the two numbers

answer:
9n - 4n = 30
5n = 30
n = 6

4.6 + 9.6
24 + 54
78

7.1.9
the ratio of teachers to students in particular school is 1 : 11
the ratio of female students to total number of students is 4 : 9
ifthere are 396 female students how many teachers are there

answer:
find value/part blocks
396 : 4 = 99 blocks


total student  = 9.99 = 891
4/9 . 891

now calc the teacher
since we know in 1 : 11 the 11 represents 891 just divideit by 11
so the totalteacher is 81


7.1.10
the ratio of losses to wins for kyle team is 3 : 2
if hte team had played the same num of games but had won
twice as many of its games, then what should the ratio of losses to wins have been?
hint: use variable to write expr for how many games kyles team won and lost

answer:
games kyles team won: 1:4


7.1.11
the ratio of pennies to dimes in a jar is 2 : 5
and there are a total of 245 pennies and dimes in the jar
how many pennies should be added to make ratio of pennies to dimes be 3 : 7

answr:
total parts = 7
find the blocks
pennies = 2/7 . 245 = 70
dimes = 5/7 . 245 = 175

since we just wanna add the penny freeze the dime count
something : 175 should be 3 : 7

find the base block count -> 175 : 7 = 25
therefore the total count should be  75 : 175

in other words the difference = 75 - 70 = 5
just add 5 more penny
