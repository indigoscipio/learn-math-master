Problem 1.7
using the two pictures below, explain why 2 x 3 = 3 x 2

the image on the left has 3 col and 2 row with a tocal of 6 boxes
the image on the right has 2col and 3 row with a total of 6 boxes
the total is the same, its the image that looks rotated

problem 1.8
by counting the dots in the picture below in two different ways, explain why
(2x3)x4 = 2x(3x4)

we have 6 boxes and within those boxes theres 4 dots
the total of the dots are 6x4 = 24
which is the same, just the grouping of the number thats different

1.9
600000

1.10 using the picture below explain why 2x1 = 2
the image depicts two box stacked vertically
the total numbero f box is 2
and theres only one stack of that box

1.11
a. compute (5+6)x7
11 x 7 = 77
b. compute 5+(6x7)
5 x 42 = 47

1.12
using the picture below, explain why 2x(3+4) = (2x3) + (2x4)

the image depicts 7 col x 2 row of boxes -> 14 total boxes
with the first 3 col and 2 row highlighted -> this is 2x3
and the remaining unhighlighed boxes is 2x4

the total of the boxes is 14

1.13
comput 51.9 + 51.31
459 + 1581

1.14
what is the value of 
17 . 13 + 51 . 13 + 32 . 13
=13(17 + 51 + 32)
=13(100)
=1300

= 221 + 663 +   416
= 1300

1.15
a. pattern: first is descreasing but 2nd remains
b. 0
