Problem 1.7
using the two pictures below, explain why 2 x 3 = 3 x 2

the image on the left has 3 col and 2 row with a tocal of 6 boxes
the image on the right has 2col and 3 row with a total of 6 boxes
the total is the same, its the image that looks rotated

problem 1.8
by counting the dots in the picture below in two different ways, explain why
(2x3)x4 = 2x(3x4)

we have 6 boxes and within those boxes theres 4 dots
the total of the dots are 6x4 = 24
which is the same, just the grouping of the number thats different

1.9
600000

1.10 using the picture below explain why 2x1 = 2
the image depicts two box stacked vertically
the total numbero f box is 2
and theres only one stack of that box

1.11
a. compute (5+6)x7
11 x 7 = 77
b. compute 5+(6x7)
5 x 42 = 47
