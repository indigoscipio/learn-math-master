(2x3)x4 = 2x(3x4)

we have 6 boxes and within those boxes theres 4 dots
the total of the dots are 6x4 = 24
which is the same, just the grouping of the number thats different

1.5 Subtraction

let a and b be any numbers
subtraction a - b is defined as

a - b = a + (-b)
subtracting a number just means adding its opposite


problem 1.21
use the definition of subtraction to answe the following questions
a. what is 0 - 17?
b. what is 17 - 17?
c. what is 17-  0 ?

answer:
by the definition of subtraction,
the subtraction of a - b is defined as
a - b = a + (-b)

a. 0 - 17
= 0 + (- 17)
= -17

b. 17 - 17
= 17 + (- 17)
= 0

c. 17 - 0
= 17 + (- 0)
= 17

Problem 1.22

a. 11 - (-13) = 11 + 13
b. -11 - 13 = -(11 + 13)
c. 11 -13 = -(13 - 11)

by the definition of subtraction,
the subtraction of a - b is defined as
a - b = a + (-b)

a. LHS -> 11 - (- 13)
= 11 + (- (- 13 ))
= 11 + 13

b. LHS -> -11 - 13
= -11 + (- 13)
= -1 (11 + 13) by distributive property
= -(11 + 13)

c. RHS -> -(13 - 11)
= -(13 + (-11))
= - 13  + -(-11)
= -13 + 11
= 11 - 13 by commutative property

1.6 Reciprocals

identity for summation = 0
since x + 0 = x itself

identity for multiplicatoin = 1


The reciprocal of x, written 1/x is the number such that

1/x . x = 1
this is also called the multiplicative inverse of x

Problems
1.29
a. what is the product of 0 and any number?
b. using part a, explain why 0 doesn't have a reciprocal

answer:
a. x . 0 = 0 so its always 0
b. by the definition of reciprocal

1/0 . 0 = 1
but since any number times 0 equals 0 therefore no solution exist
and it's impossible

2 echo = 22
2 . 11 = 22
where 11 = 22 / 2

23 echo = 2323
where
2323 = (something involving 23) + (something involving 23)

the number 222,222 is equal to the product 37,037 . 6
what is the product of 37,037 and 27?

answer:
we konw that 222222 = 37037 . 6

we need to find x = 37037 . 27
27 = 9/2 . 6

x = 37037 . 9/2 . 6
x = 37037 . 6 . 9/2
x = 222222 . 9/2
x = 111111 . 9
x = 999999 

other apporach
since we know 2222222 = 37037 . 6
then we know 111111 = 37037 . 3

given numbers a and b, let a O (operation) b equal 2a + 2b
for example, 3 O 4 equals 14

a. show that O is commutative
to check commutativity, we need to show
a O b = b O a by definition of commutative property

since we know that a O b = 2a + 2b, we need to show b O a = 2b + 2a

from the example we have
3 O 4 = 3(2) + 4(2) = 6 + 8 = 14
check for commutative
4 O 3 = 4(2) + 3(2) = 8 + 6 = 14
still equals. 
the commutative property of addition states for any numbers x and y,
x + y = y + x
since 2a and 2b are numbers, we can conclude that 2a + 2b = 2b + 2a
therefore, a O b = b O a. The operation is commutative

b. show that O is not associative
to show O is associative, we must show

(a O b) O c = a O (b O c)
LHS
2a + 2b O c
2(2a + 2b) + 2c
= 4a + 4b + 2c

RHS
a O (2b + 2c)
= 2a + 2(2b + 2c)
= 2a + 4b + 4c

therefoer the two sides are not equal, and not associative.

given numbers a and b,
let a O b equal a. for example, a O b equals 3
a. show that O is associative
b. show that O is not commutative

answer:
a. we know a O b = a that and a O b = 3
to show O is associative, we need to show

(a O b) O c = a O (b O c)
LHS
= a O c
= a

RHS
= a O b
= a

therefore the two sides are equal and is associative

b. by definition of commutative law
a O b = b O a
we need to show a O b is not commutative, that is,
we need to show LHS and RHS is not equal

LHS
a O b = a

RHS
b O a = b
therefore the equation is not commutative.

1.73
let a, b, x, and y be numbers
show that (a + b)(x + y) equals ax + ay + bx + by
answer:

distribute
= (a + b)x + (a + b)y
= ax + bx + ay + by 
= ax + ay + bx + by by commutative property

1.74
let a,b, and c be numbers
simplify the following expession
(a - (b - c))-((a - b) - c)

answer:
divide into 2 parts
(a - (b - c))
= a - b + c

((a - b) - c)
= a - b - c

combine
(a - b + c) - (a - b - c)
= a - b + c -a + b + c
= a + (-b) + c + (-a) + b + c
= a - a + b - b + c + c
= 2c

find the sum of digits in the answer to
9999..999 (94 nines) x 4444...44 (94 fours)

the first number has 94 digits each of which si a 9
the second number has 94 digits each of which is a 4

hint: simplify the problem: how would you handle 99 . 44, 999 . 444 or 9999 . 4444?
hint: multiplying 9999...99 (94 nines) by 444...44(94 fours) loks hars
is there really long numbers thats easy to multiply 4444...44 by?

answer:
9 . 4 = 36
99 . 44 = (11 . 9) . (11 . 4)
999 . 444 = (111 . 9) . (111 . 4)
obvervation: whenever the digit increaes, you add 1 extra digit to 11
99...99 . 44...99 = (11...11 . 9) . (11..11 . 4)


lets do another approach
99 = (100 - 1)
999 = (1000 - 1)
99..999 = (10....0 (95 digits) - 1)

= (10...0 - 1) * (44....44)
= (10...0 * 44...44) - (1 * 44...44)
= 94 * 94 - 94
=

given numbers a and b, define a O B to be a + ab + b
for example, 2 O 3 = 2 + 2(3) + 3 = 11

a. show that the operation O is commutative
b. show thta O is associative
c. what is the identity of O? that is, what si the identity of the
number I such that x O I = 1 for all values of x?
d. what is the inverse of 1 with respect to O, that is, what number goes in the
blank to solve __ O 1 = I, where I hs the number that you found if part c?

answer:
a. to show commutativity, we must show

a + b = b + a for all numsber a and B

since we know a O b = a + ab + b and 2 O 3 = 2 + 2(3) + 3

we need to show b O a = b + ba + a
by commutative multiplication, ba = ab
by comutatie adidtion, a + ab + b  therefore tewo sides are equal.

b. to show a O b is associative, we need to prove
(a O b) O c = a O (b O c)
LHS
= (a + ab + b) O c
let x = (a + ab + b)
= x O c
= x + xc + c
substitute back
= (a + ab + b) + (a + ab + b)c + c
= (a + ab + b) + (ac + abc + bc) + c
= a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc

RHS
a O (b O c)
= a O (b + bc + c)
let y = (b + bc + c)
= a O y
= a + ay + y
= a + a(b + bc + c) + (b + bc + c)
substitute back
= a + (ab + abc + ac) + (b + bc + c)
= a + b + c + ab + ac + bc + abc

therefore the two sides are ual, associativity is proven

c. number I such that x O I = x

x + xI + I = x
subtract both sides by x
xI + I = 0
= I(x + 1) = 0 by multiplicative identity property
I must be 0 for this to equal 0
threfore the identity element is 0

d. finding the inverse
a O 1 = I
since we found the identity = 0, we can substitute
a O 1 = 0

a + a1 + 1 = 0
a + a + 1 = 0
2a + 1 = 0
a = -1.2
