Problem 1.7
using the two pictures below, explain why 2 x 3 = 3 x 2

the image on the left has 3 col and 2 row with a tocal of 6 boxes
the image on the right has 2col and 3 row with a total of 6 boxes
the total is the same, its the image that looks rotated

problem 1.8
by counting the dots in the picture below in two different ways, explain why
(2x3)x4 = 2x(3x4)

we have 6 boxes and within those boxes theres 4 dots
the total of the dots are 6x4 = 24
which is the same, just the grouping of the number thats different

1.5 Subtraction

let a and b be any numbers
subtraction a - b is defined as

a - b = a + (-b)
subtracting a number just means adding its opposite


problem 1.21
use the definition of subtraction to answe the following questions
a. what is 0 - 17?
b. what is 17 - 17?
c. what is 17-  0 ?

answer:
by the definition of subtraction,
the subtraction of a - b is defined as
a - b = a + (-b)

a. 0 - 17
= 0 + (- 17)
= -17

b. 17 - 17
= 17 + (- 17)
= 0

c. 17 - 0
= 17 + (- 0)
= 17

Problem 1.22
use the definition of subtraction to answe the following questions
a. 11 - (-13) = 11 + 13
b. -11 - 13 = -(11 + 13)
c. 11 -13 = -(13 - 11)

by the definition of subtraction,
the subtraction of a - b is defined as
a - b = a + (-b)

a. LHS -> 11 - (- 13)
= 11 + (- (- 13 ))
= 11 + 13

b. LHS -> -11 - 13
= -11 + (- 13)
= -1 (11 + 13) by distributive property
= -(11 + 13)

c. RHS -> -(13 - 11)
= -(13 + (-11))
= - 13  + -(-11)
= -13 + 11
= 11 - 13 by commutative property

1.6 Reciprocals

identity for summation = 0
since x + 0 = x itself

identity for multiplicatoin = 1


The reciprocal of x, written 1/x is the number such that

1/x . x = 1
this is also called the multiplicative inverse of x

Problems
1.29
a. what is the product of 0 and any number?
b. using part a, explain why 0 doesn't have a reciprocal

answer:
a. x . 0 = 0 so its always 0
b. by the definition of reciprocal

1/0 . 0 = 1
but since any number times 0 equals 0 therefore no solution exist
and it's impossible
