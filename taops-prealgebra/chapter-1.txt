Problem 1.7
using the two pictures below, explain why 2 x 3 = 3 x 2

the image on the left has 3 col and 2 row with a tocal of 6 boxes
the image on the right has 2col and 3 row with a total of 6 boxes
the total is the same, its the image that looks rotated

problem 1.8
by counting the dots in the picture below in two different ways, explain why
(2x3)x4 = 2x(3x4)

we have 6 boxes and within those boxes theres 4 dots
the total of the dots are 6x4 = 24
which is the same, just the grouping of the number thats different

600000

1.10 using the picture below explain why 2x1 = 2
the image depicts two box stacked vertically
the total numbero f box is 2
and theres only one stack of that box

1.11
a. compute (5+6)x7
11 x 7 = 77
b. compute 5+(6x7)
5 x 42 = 47

1.12
using the picture below, explain why 2x(3+4) = (2x3) + (2x4)

the image depicts 7 col x 2 row of boxes -> 14 total boxes
with the first 3 col and 2 row highlighted -> this is 2x3
and the remaining unhighlighed boxes is 2x4

the total of the boxes is 14

1.3.1
what is the value of the prodcut
25 . 17 . 4 . 20?
= 100 . 20 . 17
= 2000 . 17
= 34000

1.3.2
compute 1 . 100 . 2 . 50 . 4 . 25 . 5 . 20
= 1 . 2 . 4 . 5 . 20 . 25 . 50 . 100
= (1 . 100) (2 . 50) (4 . 25) (5 . 20)
= 100 . 100 . 100 . 100
= 100.000.000

1.3.3
compute 2.2.2.2.2.5.5.5.5.5
= 10 . 10 . 10 . 10 . 10
= 100.000

1.3.4
compute 1 . 1995 . 1 = 1995

1.3.5
compute 1 . 5 . 1 . 5 . 1 . 5
= 5 . 5 . 5
= 125

1.3.6
Using the distributive property, evaluate the following expressions
a. 11 . 43 + 11 . 57
= 11 (43 + 57)
= 11 (100)
= 1100

b. 22 . 6 + 6 . 38
= 6 (22 + 38)
= 6 (60)
= 360

c. 32 . 16 + 16 . 48
= 16 (32 + 48)
= 16 (80)
= 1280

1.3.7
find numbers a,b,c such that a + (b.c) is not equal to (a + b) . (a + c)
in other words find example to illustrate that addition does not distrubute over multiplication

let a = 1
let b = 1
let c = 2

1 + (1 . 2)
= 1 + 2
= 3

(1 + 1) (1 + 2)
2 . 3
= 6

LHS and RHS are not equal

1.3.8
compute 456 + 456 + 456 + 456 + 456 + 456 + 456 + 456 + 456 + 456
= 10 (456)
= 4560

1.3.9
what is the product of the number 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 0
answer = 0

1.3.10
compute 10 + 110 . 0 . 101 + 111
= 10 + 0 +  111
= 121

 ====================

 Negation

 the negation of a number x, written -x
 is the number that we add to x to get 0

 -x + x = 0

 Problems 1.18
 mltiplying by -1: let x be a number then
 -x = -(1)x

using the fact that -x = (-1)x explain why
 (-2) . 3 = -(2 . 3)

 LHS
=((-1) . 2) . 3
= -1 (2 . 3)
= - (2 . 3)

Problem 1.19
using problem 1.18, explain why
(-2)(-3) = 2 . 3

LHS
= ((-1) . 2) . ((-1) . 3)
= (-1 . -1) (2 . 3)
= 1 . (2 . 3)
= (2 . 3)

Problem 1.20
using the fact that -x = (-1)x explain why

-(4 + 5) = (-4) + (-5)
LHS
(-1) (4 + 5)
= (-1 . 4) + (- 1 . 5)
= -4 + -5
