6.1.10
curt mistakenly multiplied a number by 10 when he shouldve divided the number by 10
the answer he found was 33.66 more than the answer he should've found. find the original number

hjint: its a word problem. what is our usual strategy for word problem
hint: assign a variable, write an equation

answer:
let n be kurts original number
mistake -> n . 10
should have -> n / 10

n . 10 = 33.66 + (n / 10)
multiply both side by 10
10 (10n) = 10 . 33.66 + 10 . n/10
100n = 336.6 + n
99n = 336.6
n = 336.6/99 = 3366/990

e. round 0.03 to the nearest tenth
f. round 0.1972 to the nearest hundreth
g. round -2.35 to the nearest tenth
h. round 1.995 to the nearest hundreth

answer:
a. 700
b. -3,000
c. 1.7
d. 0.003
e. 0.0
f. 0.20
g. -2.30
h. 2.00

problem 6.7
a. round 4.73, 4.739 and 4.7395 each to the nearest tenth
b. when rounding a positive number to the nearest tenth, which digit
determines wheter the number you round is to is larger or smaller than the original number?

answer:
a
4.73 -> 4.7
4.739 -> 4.7
4.7395 -> 4.7

b. the idgit that determines this is the one directly to the right of the place you are rounding to
. for the tenth, the decider is the hundreds

problem 6.8
suppose you are told that the number x rounds to 2.7 when rounded to the nearest tnenth
what can you conclude about x ?

answer:
the hundreds digit must be 5 - 9
so previously its like 2.65 or something whn its rounded to 2.7
largest must be 2.75 (up to but not including) and smallest must be 2.65

problem 6.9
suppose your frinds tells you that 5,912 . 7,832 equals 51,663,744
is this reasonable? why or why not?

answer:
lets try to round to thousand first
6000 . 8000 = 48,000,000 so its somewhere around this

more acurate, round ot nearest hundred
5900 . 7800 = 59 . 78 = 46,020,000

therefore it must be more close to ~46,000,000 than to 51,000,000

6.2.1
round 28.2508 to
a. nearest ten
30

b. nearest tenth
28.3

c. nearest hundreth
28.25

6.2.2
round -0.155 to
a. the nearest integer
0

b. nearest tenth
-0.10 vs -0.20 - 0.20 is larger

c. nearest hundreth
-0.150 vs -0.160
larger one is -0.150


6.23
round 7.6397 to the nearest thousandth
answer: 7,639 - 7.640
its larger to 7.640

6.24
find a number x such that x rounded to the nearest tenth is 1.8,
x rounded to nearest hundreth is 1.82
x rounded to nearest thousandth is 1.819

answr:

nearest tenth must be 1.8: 1.75 <= x < 1.85
nearest hundreth must be 1.82:  1.815 <= x < 1.825
nearest thousandth must be 1.819:  1.8185 <= x < 1.8195

1.819


6.2.5
the fraction 401/0.205 is closest to which of the following numbers?

0.2
2
20
200
2000 ?

answer:
401 / 205 * 10^-3
401 : 205 / 1000
401 * 1000 / 205
401 * 200 / 41
so approx 400 * 5
should be close to 2000

a ball is dropped from height of 3 meter
on its first bounce it rises to height of 2m
it keeps falling and bouncing to 2/3 of the height it reached in the previous bounce
on which bounce will it first not rise to a height of 0.5 meters

answer:
first bounce = 2
then next boune = 2 . 2/3 = 4/3 = 1 1/3
we need to find the nearest bounce above 0.5

if we keep bouncing it,
3rd
4/3 . 2/3
8/9

4th
8/9 . 2/3
16/27

5th
16/27 . 2/3
32/81
since 81 is more than 2 . 32 its below half

on a calculator julian divided x into y and got the answer 1.0625
both x and y were positive integers less than 50
but he can't remember what they were
what is the sum of all possible values of x and y?

hint: start by finding one pair x and y

answer:
ok so initally he divides  y : x = 1.0625
and we know x and y are pos int < 50

lets try finding a pair first
1.0625 = 10625 * 10^-4 but we know its < 50
need another alternativ

11 / 10 = 1.1
24 / 25 = 96/100 = 0.96
26 / 25 = 104/100 = 1.04 - close
27 / 25 = 108/ 100 = 1.08 -close


so it's somweher between 26/25 to 27/25
26.5/25?

hmm how do i do this accurarely
break the decimal apart
1 + 0.0625
1/2 is 0.5
1/4 is 0.25
1/8 is 0.125

so the decimal part is
1/2 + 1/8 = 5/8 * 1/10 = 5/80 = 1/16

sum them together
1 + 1/16
17/16

alternative version is 34/32

so the sum should be 
17 + 16 + 34 + 32 = 99
