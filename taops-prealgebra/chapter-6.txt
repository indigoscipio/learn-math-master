netty used a calc to find product 0.075 . 2.56 she forgot to enter decimal pts
the calc showed 19200 if betty had entered decimal pts corectly what should the answer been

answer: it has 3 + 2 decimal point so shoudl be 5 deciaml pts corect answer shoud be
0.19200

just to check
75.10^-3 * 256. 10^-2
19200 . 10^-5


6.1.8
which of folowing is equal to 1000 . 1993 . 0.1993 . 10

 1.993 . 10^3
 1993.1993
 1993^2
 1993,001.993
 1993^2

 answer:
 lets evaluate the whoel thing wfirst
1000 . 1993 . 0.1993 . 10
1993 . 119.3.10
1993 . 1993

so it shold be 1993^2

6.1.9

if 0.0481 . 10^-4 = 4.81 . n, what is n?

answer:
0.0481 = 4.81 . 10^-2 (move 2 digit to the right)
subtitute back
4.81 . 10^-2  . 10^-4 
4.81 . 10^-2-4
4.81 . 10^-6

6.1.10
curt mistakenly multiplied a number by 10 when he shouldve divided the number by 10
the answer he found was 33.66 more than the answer he should've found. find the original number

hjint: its a word problem. what is our usual strategy for word problem
hint: assign a variable, write an equation

answer:
let n be kurts original number
mistake -> n . 10
should have -> n / 10

n . 10 = 33.66 + (n / 10)
multiply both side by 10
10 (10n) = 10 . 33.66 + 10 . n/10
100n = 336.6 + n
99n = 336.6
n = 336.6/99 = 3366/990

ROUNDING

problmes
a. round 697 to the nearest hundred
b. round -2,712 to the nearest thousand
c. round 1.651 to the nearest tenth
d. round 0.00282 to the nearest thousandth
e. round 0.03 to the nearest tenth
f. round 0.1972 to the nearest hundreth
g. round -2.35 to the nearest tenth
h. round 1.995 to the nearest hundreth

answer:
a. 700
b. -3,000
c. 1.7
d. 0.003
e. 0.0
f. 0.20
g. -2.30
h. 2.00

problem 6.7
a. round 4.73, 4.739 and 4.7395 each to the nearest tenth
b. when rounding a positive number to the nearest tenth, which digit
determines wheter the number you round is to is larger or smaller than the original number?

answer:
a
4.73 -> 4.7
4.739 -> 4.7
4.7395 -> 4.7

b. the idgit that determines this is the one directly to the right of the place you are rounding to
. for the tenth, the decider is the hundreds

problem 6.8
suppose you are told that the number x rounds to 2.7 when rounded to the nearest tnenth
what can you conclude about x ?

answer:
the hundreds digit must be 5 - 9
so previously its like 2.65 or something whn its rounded to 2.7
largest must be 2.75 (up to but not including) and smallest must be 2.65

problem 6.9
suppose your frinds tells you that 5,912 . 7,832 equals 51,663,744
is this reasonable? why or why not?

answer:
lets try to round to thousand first
6000 . 8000 = 48,000,000 so its somewhere around this

more acurate, round ot nearest hundred
5900 . 7800 = 59 . 78 = 46,020,000

therefore it must be more close to ~46,000,000 than to 51,000,000

6.2.1
round 28.2508 to
a. nearest ten
30

b. nearest tenth
28.3

c. nearest hundreth
28.25

6.2.2
round -0.155 to
a. the nearest integer
0

b. nearest tenth
-0.10 vs -0.20 - 0.20 is larger

c. nearest hundreth
-0.150 vs -0.160
larger one is -0.150


6.23
round 7.6397 to the nearest thousandth
answer: 7,639 - 7.640
its larger to 7.640

6.24
find a number x such that x rounded to the nearest tenth is 1.8,
x rounded to nearest hundreth is 1.82
x rounded to nearest thousandth is 1.819

answr:

nearest tenth must be 1.8: 1.75 <= x < 1.85
nearest hundreth must be 1.82:  1.815 <= x < 1.825
nearest thousandth must be 1.819:  1.8185 <= x < 1.8195

1.819


6.2.5
the fraction 401/0.205 is closest to which of the following numbers?

0.2
2
20
200
2000 ?

answer:
401 / 205 * 10^-3
401 : 205 / 1000
401 * 1000 / 205
401 * 200 / 41
so approx 400 * 5
should be close to 2000
