curt mistakenly multiplied a number by 10 when he shouldve divided the number by 10
the answer he found was 33.66 more than the answer he should've found. find the original number

hjint: its a word problem. what is our usual strategy for word problem
hint: assign a variable, write an equation

answer:
let n be kurts original number
mistake -> n . 10
should have -> n / 10

n . 10 = 33.66 + (n / 10)
multiply both side by 10
10 (10n) = 10 . 33.66 + 10 . n/10
100n = 336.6 + n
99n = 336.6
n = 336.6/99 = 3366/990

problem 6.7
a. round 4.73, 4.739 and 4.7395 each to the nearest tenth
b. when rounding a positive number to the nearest tenth, which digit
determines wheter the number you round is to is larger or smaller than the original number?

answer:
a
4.73 -> 4.7
4.739 -> 4.7
4.7395 -> 4.7

b. the idgit that determines this is the one directly to the right of the place you are rounding to
. for the tenth, the decider is the hundreds

problem 6.8
suppose you are told that the number x rounds to 2.7 when rounded to the nearest tnenth
what can you conclude about x ?

answer:
the hundreds digit must be 5 - 9
so previously its like 2.65 or something whn its rounded to 2.7
largest must be 2.75 (up to but not including) and smallest must be 2.65

problem 6.9
suppose your frinds tells you that 5,912 . 7,832 equals 51,663,744
is this reasonable? why or why not?

answer:
lets try to round to thousand first
6000 . 8000 = 48,000,000 so its somewhere around this

more acurate, round ot nearest hundred
5900 . 7800 = 59 . 78 = 46,020,000

therefore it must be more close to ~46,000,000 than to 51,000,000

on a calculator julian divided x into y and got the answer 1.0625
both x and y were positive integers less than 50
but he can't remember what they were
what is the sum of all possible values of x and y?

hint: start by finding one pair x and y

answer:
ok so initally he divides  y : x = 1.0625
and we know x and y are pos int < 50

lets try finding a pair first
1.0625 = 10625 * 10^-4 but we know its < 50
need another alternativ

11 / 10 = 1.1
24 / 25 = 96/100 = 0.96
26 / 25 = 104/100 = 1.04 - close
27 / 25 = 108/ 100 = 1.08 -close


so it's somweher between 26/25 to 27/25
26.5/25?

hmm how do i do this accurarely
break the decimal apart
1 + 0.0625
1/2 is 0.5
1/4 is 0.25
1/8 is 0.125

so the decimal part is
1/2 + 1/8 = 5/8 * 1/10 = 5/80 = 1/16

sum them together
1 + 1/16
17/16

alternative version is 34/32

so the sum should be 
17 + 16 + 34 + 32 = 99

problem 6.18
a. when we convert the fractions
1/2,1/3,1/4,...,1/10
to decimal form which of them have finite decimals and which of them have infinitely
repeating decimals?

answer:
lets try it 1 by 1
1/2 -> 0.5 so no repeating decimal
1/3 -> 0.333.. - repeating decimal
1/4 -> 0.25 - no repeating deciaml
1/5 -> 0.2 - no repeat
1/6 > repeeating
1/7 - repeat
1/8 - no repeat
1/9 - repeat
1/10 - no repeat

b. suppose n >=2 is pos int. is there easy way to tlel if the deicmal form of 1/n
is finite or infinitely repeating?

if i had to guess
if n is even then its not repeating
if n is odd then it could repeat (except for 5)

correction
finite -> has prime factor that consists of 2 and 5
inifinte -> has prime factors other than 2 and 5

problem 6.19
what is the 100th digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of
3/7?
answer:

1/7 = 0.142857...
3/7 = 0.428571...

remainder 100 / 6 = 4
so on the 96 digit loops agian
4 - 97
2 - 98
8 - 99
5 - 100

therefore the 100th digit is the number 5

by how much does 0.6363... exceed 0.63?
express your answer as a fraction.
answer:

lets evaluate the repeating in terms of fraction
0.6363...
= 63/99
= 7/11

0.63 = 63/100

to find the difference subtract
7/11 - 63/100
lcm 11,100 = 1100
700 - 693/1100

a positive number is written in scientific notation in form a . 10^b
where a is a number 1 <= a < 10
b is an integer

for example 38100 is written 3.81 . 10^4 in scientific nitation
0.025 is written 2.5 . 10^-2
a. explain why every positive number can be written in scientific notation.

answer:
because scieintific number the way it combines the base number and the decimal
wheter its 0.0000... or 100000++ if we want to add or remove the zero just modify the 10^b thing
and if we want to change the base just change the a

b. write the product (3.10^5).(4.10^6) in scientific notation
12.10^11
since the base b  needs to be 1 < b < 9
= 1.2 . 10^12

c. write the quotient (3 . 10^2) : (5 . 10^-3) in scientific notation
answer:
3/5 . 10^2--3
3/5 . 10^5
0.6 . 10^5
6 . 10^4

d. if positive integer n is expressed in scientific notation as a . 10^b
how many digits does n have when written out?

answer:
lets start with small example
101 = 1.01 . 10^2
where a = 1.01 and b = 2
if 101 is expressed as 1.01 . 10^2
then when written out it has 3 digit?
so b + 1 digit

cos it contained one decimal digit ot the left
the exponent tells how many digit added after that

what is the smallest positive integer k such that
k/660 can be expressed as a terminating decimal

answer:

need to find finite factor fort he denuminator eg 2,5 or both

110/660 -> 11/66 -> 1/6 - not finite
33/660 -> 1/20 -> 0.05 - finite
can it be smaller?
3/660 -> 1/220 - not finite

it seems 33/660 is the smallest so k = 33

660 = 2 . 2 . 5 . 3 . 11
the 3 and 11 is making it reapeat
need to cancel it out with the numerator

33 / 660 = 33 / 33 . 20 = 1 / 20 = 0.05

suppose that x is repeating decimal of the form 0.kk...
where k is a n digit number (for some positive integer n)
for example if k = 234 then n = 3 and x = 0.238238...
show that x equals k divided by the n digit number consisting of all 9s, that is

x = 0.kkk... = k / 9....9 with n nines

answer:

lets start with smalle exmale
k = 238
n = 3
x = 0.238238...

1000x - x = 238.238... - 0.238238...
999x = 238
x = 238/999

where the denominator has exactly 3 digit
now to generatlize

if k has n digit
10^n . x = k.kkk....

substract
10^n . x - x = (k.kkkk...) - (0.kkkk....)
(10^n-1)x = k
x = k / 10^n-1

6.36
how many digits are in the decimal expansion of 10^30?
asnwer:
at first it feels like the answer is 30 digits but lets check
10^1 = 10 - expo = 1, digit = 2
10^2 = 100 - expo = 2, digit = 3
10^3 = 1000 - expo = 3, digit = 4
so by this pattern i assume it wille reach 10^3 eventually
where expo = 30 and digit = 30+1 = 31
so the d = expo + 1

b. how many digits are in the decimal expansion of 2^30?
hint can you find a power of two thats near 100, 1000, or 10000?

answer:
hmm lets try finding factors of 30
2 . 3 . 5

modifying the power
power of two thats near 100 = 2^6 (64) or 2^7 (128)
power of two thats near 1000 = 2^10 (1024)
(2^6)^5
or something lke (2^10)^3
(1024)^3
try to approximate the digit here so it should be somethin like
1000 . 1000 . 1000
~1000000000 so the total digit = 10

min - 1000^3
max - 2000^3
so it should be between 1000000000 and 8000000000
which has 10 digits

c. how many digits are in the deicmal expression of 5^30?
hint: if you multiply 5digit number with 10digit number what are the possibilities for
numuber of digit of the product?

answer:
lets start simple if we mult 2d . 2d
eg 10 . 10 -> total = 100 = 3 digits, so thats 2d + 2d - 1d
multiply 5d . 10d = 15 + 5 -1 = 19 digits?

10^30 = (2 x 5)^30 = 2^30 . 5^30

6.37
how many positive integers less than 100 have reciprocals with terminating deicmal representation?

answer:
we know that terminating decimalhave only pime factor of 2 or 5 or both
so positive integers less than 100
with only 2 or 5 or both prime factors would be something like
2,5,10,20,40,50,80

multiples of 2
2,4,6,8,..

systematic approach
2^a . 5^b
no 5s: 1, 2,4,8,16,32,64 -> closest too 100 is 2^6 so 6 factors
one 5s: 5,10,20,40,80, -> 5 factors 
two 5s: 25,50 -> 2 factors
three 5s: too big

so the total is 6+5+3 = 14 total that have terminating deicmals

answer:
(7 . 10^-1) + (7 . 10^-2) + (7 . 10^-3) + ... + (7 . 10^-n)
7 (10^-1 + 10^-2 ... + 10^-n)

in terms of decimal it should be something like
0.7 + 0.07 + 0.007 + ...
so logically it should be something like
0.77777....
7/9

b. compute the infinite sum
6/10 + 3/100 + 6/1000 + 3/10000
answer:
this is something like
0.636363....
so it shold be someting like 63/99
= 21/33
= 7/11

c. compute the infinite sum
1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + 1/81
answer:
this should be something like this in fractions
(1/3^1) + (1/3^2) + (1/3^3) + ...

1/2

nanette rounds 10.68494 to the nearest hundreth
duane rounds 10.68494 to nearest integer

what is the postiive diference etween the two answer? expresss as fraction
nanette = 10.68494 since its nearest hundred check for the thousands/next decimal which will be the decider
since its 4 we can round as 10.68

duanne: nearest integer 
10.6 since 1st decimal is > 5 we can round this as 11

so the difference is 11 - 10.68
0.32 = 32/100 = 8/25
