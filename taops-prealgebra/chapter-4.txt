why do we need fractions at all?
when we cant fully divide a number / when division doesnt resutl in whole number

if a is a number and b is a nonzero number
the fraction a/b equals to a : b

reciprocal vs fraction
reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) = flip number upside odwn
fraction = number that reprsent something

what is 2 . 1/3
answer: 2/3

4.9
in this problem, we compute 3.4/5
a. use the definition of division to write 4/5 as the product of an integer
and the reciprocal of integer
answer: by the definition of division,
a / b = 1 . a/b
so 3 . 4/5 = 3 . 4 . 1/5
= 12 . 1/5
= 12/5

b. use the appropriate propertyies of multiplication and your result from part a to compute
3 . 4/5 (by compute we mean find a number that equals 3 . 4/5)

3 . 4/5
= 3 . 4 . 1/5

5/6 times what fraction equals 5/7?

answer:
5/6 * a/b = 5/7
a/b = 5/7 * 6/5
a/b = 30/35
a/b = 6/7

alternative
5/6 * a/7
a = 6 to cancel the denumerator


b. 5/6 times what fration equals 4/7?

answer
5/6 * a/7 = 4/7
5a/42 = 4/7
5a * 1/42 = 4/7
5a = 4/7 * 42
5a = 4 * 6
5a = 24
a = 24/5

if a is divided by b
the result if 3/4
a/b = 3/4

if b is divided by c
the result is 11/13
b/c = 11/13

what is the result when a is divided by c?

answer:
since we know a/b = 3/4
a . 1/b = 3/4
a = 3/4 * b

b/c = 11/13
b . 1/c = 11/13
b = 11/13 * c
13/11 * b = c
c = 13/11 * b

a/c = 3/4 b / 13/11b
= 3/4 . 11/13
= 33 / 52

alternative
since we know a/b and b/c
we can multiply them to get a/b . b/c = a/c

a/c = a/b . b/c
= 3/4 * 11/13 = 33/52

6 / n = 3
6 = 3n
6/3 = n
n = 2

b. dividing 6/7 by what number gives 6/5?

answer:
6/7 / n = 6/5
multiply both sides by n
= 6/7 = 6/5 n
multiply both sides by 5/6
= 6/7 * 5/6 = n
= 30/42 = n
= 15/21
= 5/7


c. dividing 6/7 by what number gives 2/3

4.3.7
multiplying a number by 3/4 then dividing the result by 3/5 has the same effect
as multiplying the original number by what number?

answer:
simplify
let n = 2
multiply by 3*4 -> 2  * 3/4 = 3/2 : 3/5 = 3/2 * 5/3 = 15/6 = 5/2

3/4 / 3/5
= 3/4 * 5/3 = 15/12 = 5/4

therefore 5/4

6 : 1 = 6 scoops

so its 6 : 2/3 = 6 * 3/2 = 18/2 = 9 scoopos

answer: 2^3 / 5^3 = 8/125

b. let b be nonzero and n b epositive integer
explain why (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n
answer: because by definition of exponent
its repeated multiplicatin n times so we need to multiply

suppose a and b are nonzero and n is a positive intger
explain why

= b^n / a^n

or alternatively
= 1/(a/b)^n
= 1 * (b/a)^n
= (b/a)^n - apply eponent to num and denom
= b^n / a^n

by showing that a^-n / b^-n also equals b^n / a^n

answer:

a^-n / b^-n
numerator
a^-n = 1/a^n

denominator
b^-n = 1/b^n

combine
1/a^n : 1/b^n
= 1/a^n * b^n / 1

Comparing fracino

4.34
which is greater 3/5 or 4/5
answer: 4/5 since the numerator is greater and denumerator is the same

in this problem, we determine which is greater,
3/5 or 7/10
a. what fraction with denominator 10 is equal to 3/5?
b. which is greater, 3/5 or 7/10?

answer:
a. 6/10 = 3/5
b. since we know 3/5 = 6/10 we can compare
which is greater 6/10 vs 7/10?
7/10 is greater.

or using cross multiplication
30 * 35

4.36
a. which is greater 5/7 or 8/11
answer: 55 * 56 so 56 is greater so 8/11

b. which is greater 5/6 or 7/9
answer: 45 vs 42 so 5/6 is greater

4.37
which is greater 2/7 or 2/5?
since the numerator is already the same 2/5 is greater

4.38
which is greater -17/14 or -41/35
answer:

-595 vs -576 so -41/35 is greater


4.39
which is greater 541/539 or 399/401
answer: 541/539 has the numerator greater than denumerator its greater than 1


4.6.1
in each of the following pairs of numbers hwich number is the smaller

a. 3/2, 7/5
answer: 
15/10 vs 14/10 so 3/2 is greater

b. 1/2 vs -3/4
= 2/4 vs -3/4
so -3/4 is smaller 

c. -3/5 is smaller

4.6.2
for each of the following lists of numbers arrange the numbers in decreasing order
largest to smallest

a. 1/2, 3/4, 5/12
= 6/12 vs 9/12 vs 5/ 12
so 9/12, 6/12, 5/12 -> 3/4, 1/2, 5/12

b. 3/4, 2/3, 5/8
lcm(4,3,8)
4 -> 2^2
3 -> 3^1
8 -> 2^3
= 2^3 . 3^1 = 8*3 = 24

18/24, 16/24, 15/24
3/4, 2/3 ,5/8

c.-5/4, -3, 5/2, -13/3
= -5/4, -3/3, 5/2, -13/3

= lcm(4,3,2) 
2^2 . 3^1 = 12
= -15/12, -12/12, 30/12, -52/12
largest to smallest is
= 30/12, -15/12, -12/12 ,-52/12
=5/2, -5/4, -3, -13/3

4.6.3
which of these numbers is less than its reciprocal
-2, -1, 0, 1, 2

-2 -> -1/2 = -2 is less than reciprocal
-1 -> -1/1 = -1, the same/equal
0 -> 1/0 = 0 = undefined since divided by 0
1 -> 1/1 -> the same
2 -> 1/2 -> 2 is greater than its reciprocal

therefore th answer is -2

4.6.4
which number is greater
3/2011 or 3/2012

answer: 3/2011 since it has lower lower denominatur

4.6.5
which number is greater, 19/30 or 22/35
answer:
= 665 vs 660 so 19/30 is greater

alternative, use lcm
(lcm (30,35))


4.6.6
which number is greater, 506/101 or 509/102
since 101 fits 5 time with some fraction so its greater than 5
vs 509/102 is less than 5 since 102 . 5 = 510

so 506/101 is greater
