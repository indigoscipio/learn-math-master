why do we need fractions at all?
when we cant fully divide a number / when division doesnt resutl in whole number

if a is a number and b is a nonzero number
the fraction a/b equals to a : b

reciprocal vs fraction
reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) = flip number upside odwn
fraction = number that reprsent something

if a is divided by b
the result if 3/4
a/b = 3/4

if b is divided by c
the result is 11/13
b/c = 11/13

what is the result when a is divided by c?

answer:
since we know a/b = 3/4
a . 1/b = 3/4
a = 3/4 * b

b/c = 11/13
b . 1/c = 11/13
b = 11/13 * c
13/11 * b = c
c = 13/11 * b

a/c = 3/4 b / 13/11b
= 3/4 . 11/13
= 33 / 52

alternative
since we know a/b and b/c
we can multiply them to get a/b . b/c = a/c

a/c = a/b . b/c
= 3/4 * 11/13 = 33/52

= 3^3 . 2 = 54

62 +45 - 48 /54
= 59/54

d. 2^-1 + 3^-1
= 1/2 + 1/3
= 3+2/6 = 5/6

e. 
3/2 + 5/3
= 9+10/6
= 19/6 - 7/6
= 12/6 = 2

f. 8 / 2 - 2/3
denominator
2 - 2/3
= 6-2/3 = 4/3
8 * 3/4
= 2*3 = 6

g. 3/4 + 6 - 7/2
= 3/4 + 24/4 - 14/4
= 13/4

h. 2/3 + 5/6 / 3/4 - 1/2
= 4+5/6 / 3-2/4
= 9/6 / 1/4
= 3/2 / 1/4
= 3/2 * 4
= 3 * 2 = 6

how much greater is 2003/25 + 25 than 2003+25 / 25
answer:
we know 2000/25 = 80

2003/25 + 25
so this is close to ~80 + 25 = ~105

2003+25 / 25 = 2028 / 25
this one is close to approximately 81

so the difference is approximately 105-81 = 24
or you dont need to calculate 2000/25 just see the difference in fractions

4.7.4

one third of the girls have blond hair
one quarter boys have blond hair

a. what fraction of the students in central middle school have blond hair?
hint: what fraction of students in central middle school are boys with blond hair?

answer:

boys = 2/5 of total students
girls = 5/5 - 2/5 = 3/5 of total students
girls with blond hair = 1/3 * 3/5 = 3/15 = 1/5 of total girls
boys with blond hair = 1/4 * 2/5 = 2/20 = 1/10 of total boys

total students that have blond hair:
girls with blond hair + boys with blond hair
= 1/5 + 1/10 = 2+1/10 = 3/10

b. if 36 of the students in central middle have blond hair
then how many students total does central middle have

36 -> this amount represnts 3/10 total student in central middle

find the number halfway between -2 5/6 and 3/5 on the number line

hint: solve a similar simple problem

hint: how do you find the number halfway between -97 and 133 on the number line?

answer:
small example
mid number between -2 and 2 -> 0
mid number between 3 and 9 -> 3+9/2 = 12/2 = 6
mid number between -4 and 0 -> -4+0/2 = -2
-97 and 133 -> -97+133/2 = 18
you just sum the start and end number and divide by 2


so the halfway number between -2 5/6 and 3/5
= -17/6 + 3/5
= -85+18/30 = -67/30 / 2
= -67/30 * 1/2
= -67/60
= -1 7/60

two 600ml pitchers contain vinegar
one pitcher is 1/3 full
the other 2/5 full
oil is added to fill each pitcher compltely
both pitchers are poured into one large container
what fraction of the mixture in the large container is vinegar

answer:
p1 = 1/3
p2 = 2/5
oil1 = 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3
oil2 = 5/5 - 2/5 = 3/5

large container content
p1+p2 = 5+6/15 = 11/15
oil1+oil2  = 10+9/15 = 19/15
so the fraction that contains vinegar is p1+p2 = 11/15 : 2
= 11/15 * 1/2
= 11/30

alternatie approach

1/3 . 600 = 200
2/5 . 600 = 240
total = 1200
440/1200 = 44/120 = 11/30

i climb half the steps in a staircase
next i climb 1/3 of the remaining
then i climb 1/8 of ther rest and stop to catch my breath
what is he least possible number of steps in the staircase?

answer:
ok lets do this one by one
so first i climbed 1/2 -> 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 which is the curr remainnig
next is 1/3 so 1/2 of 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6
so curr remaining now = 1/2 - 1/6 = 6-2/12 = 4/12 = 1/3
and i climbed 1/8 of 1/3 = 1/24
1/3 - 1/24 = 8-1/24 = 7/24

the answer is lcm 2,6,24 = 24
