why do we need fractions at all?
when we cant fully divide a number / when division doesnt resutl in whole number

if a is a number and b is a nonzero number
the fraction a/b equals to a : b

reciprocal vs fraction
reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) = flip number upside odwn
fraction = number that reprsent something


problem 4.1
simplify thefollowing fractions
a. 0/7 = 0
b. 5/5 = 1
c. 2/1 = 2
d. 12/6 = 2
e. -12/3 = -4
f. 22+13/-4-3 = 35/-7=-5

problem 4.2
for what values of n between 1 and 40 is n/7 an integer?
answer:
im not sure, lets check with examples
n = 1 -> 1/7 -> around 0.1
n = 2 -> 2/7
n = 40 -> 40/7 = around 5.7

: 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35.

division of a fraction
a / b = a . 1/b
reciprocal ofa produc
1/ab = 1/a . 1/b

4.8
what is 2 . 1/3
answer: 2/3

4.9
in this problem, we compute 3.4/5
a. use the definition of division to write 4/5 as the product of an integer
and the reciprocal of integer
answer: by the definition of division,
a / b = 1 . a/b
so 3 . 4/5 = 3 . 4 . 1/5
= 12 . 1/5
= 12/5

b. use the appropriate propertyies of multiplication and your result from part a to compute
3 . 4/5 (by compute we mean find a number that equals 3 . 4/5)

3 . 4/5
= 3 . 4 . 1/5
= 12/5

4.10
in this problem, we compute 66666 * 7/6
a. explain why 66666 * 7/6 = 66666/6 . 7 
answer: by the definition of division of fraction,
= 66666 * 7 * 1/6
= 66666 * 1/6 * 7 by associative property
= 66666 / 6 * 7

b. compute 66666 . 7/6
= 11111 * 7 = 77777

2/3 * 4/5
2 . 1/3 * 4 . 1/5
= 8 * 1/3 * 1*5
= 8 * 1/15
= 8/15

4.13
compute 35/8 * 48/7
35 * 1/8 * 48 * 1/7
= 35 * 48 * 1/8 * 1/7
= 35/7 * 48/8
= 5 * 6 = 30

4.14
a. what is 2/3 of 90
b. what is 3/4 of 11/4

answer:
a. 2/3 * 90 = 2 . 30 = 60
b. 3/4 * 11/8 = 33 / 32

4.15
160 * 3/5 = 96
3/4 * 96 = 72

9/20 . 160 =  72


===========================================================

if d is nonzero, then:
a . c/d = ac / d

we can use 
a . c/d = ac/d = a/d . c to simplify computations

a/b . c/d = ac/bd

what is 3/4 of 8/9 of 180
answer:
8/9 of 180 = 8/9 * 180 = 160
3/4 * 160 = 120

3/4 * 8/9 * 180
=3*8/4*9 * 180
= 2/3 * 180 = 120

answer:
1*2*3*4/2*3*4*5 * 100

5/6 times what fraction equals 5/7?

answer:
5/6 * a/b = 5/7
a/b = 5/7 * 6/5
a/b = 30/35
a/b = 6/7

alternative
5/6 * a/7
a = 6 to cancel the denumerator


b. 5/6 times what fration equals 4/7?

answer
5/6 * a/7 = 4/7
5a/42 = 4/7
5a * 1/42 = 4/7
5a = 4/7 * 42
5a = 4 * 6
5a = 24
a = 24/5

24/5/7
= 24/5 * 1/7
= 24/35

4.2.8
if a is divided by b
the result if 3/4
a/b = 3/4

if b is divided by c
the result is 11/13
b/c = 11/13

what is the result when a is divided by c?

answer:
since we know a/b = 3/4
a . 1/b = 3/4
a = 3/4 * b

b/c = 11/13
b . 1/c = 11/13
b = 11/13 * c
13/11 * b = c
c = 13/11 * b

a/c = 3/4 b / 13/11b
= 3/4 . 11/13
= 33 / 52

alternative
since we know a/b and b/c
we can multiply them to get a/b . b/c = a/c

a/c = a/b . b/c
= 3/4 * 11/13 = 33/52
