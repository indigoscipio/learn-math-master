why do we need fractions at all?
when we cant fully divide a number / when division doesnt resutl in whole number

if a is a number and b is a nonzero number
the fraction a/b equals to a : b

reciprocal vs fraction
reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) = flip number upside odwn
fraction = number that reprsent something


problem 4.1
simplify thefollowing fractions
a. 0/7 = 0
b. 5/5 = 1
c. 2/1 = 2
d. 12/6 = 2
e. -12/3 = -4
f. 22+13/-4-3 = 35/-7=-5

problem 4.2
for what values of n between 1 and 40 is n/7 an integer?
answer:
im not sure, lets check with examples
n = 1 -> 1/7 -> around 0.1
n = 2 -> 2/7
n = 40 -> 40/7 = around 5.7

: 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35.

4.3
a: 1 4/5 (9/5)
b: 1/5
c: -3/5
d: -1 2/5 (-7/5)

4.4
b. between what consecutive integers is 43/5
we know 8*5 = 40
so lowest is 8 and next is 9

4.5
b = 4/8
c = 15/7
a = -4/7
d = 21/7

4.7
find two fractions equal to 2/3
answer:
4/6
6/9

4.1.1
find the value of each following:
a. -6/6 -> -1
b. 18/3 -> 6
c. 1
d. 0

4.1.2
compute 16+6/4-2
22/2 = 11

4.1.3
11

4.1.4
6

4.1.5
x = -12
y = 4

-12.4 - (-12)/4
= -48 - (-3)
= -48 + 3
= -45

4.1.6
a = 7/6
b = -8/4
c = -1/3
d = 11/6

4.1.7
6/10, 9/15, 12/20

4.1.8
for how many posiitve integer values of n is the expr
36 / n+1 an integer?

hint: if a / b is an integer then how are a and b related?

answer:
a must be the multiple of b for a/b to be an integer
eg 2/2, 4/2, etc


find positive factors of 36
1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36
subtract 1
0,1,2,3,5,8,11,17,35
remove nonzero -> total = 8

===============

division of a fraction
a / b = a . 1/b
reciprocal ofa produc
1/ab = 1/a . 1/b

4.8
what is 2 . 1/3
answer: 2/3

4.9
in this problem, we compute 3.4/5
a. use the definition of division to write 4/5 as the product of an integer
and the reciprocal of integer
answer: by the definition of division,
a / b = 1 . a/b
so 3 . 4/5 = 3 . 4 . 1/5
= 12 . 1/5
= 12/5

b. use the appropriate propertyies of multiplication and your result from part a to compute
3 . 4/5 (by compute we mean find a number that equals 3 . 4/5)

3 . 4/5
= 3 . 4 . 1/5
= 12/5

4.10
in this problem, we compute 66666 * 7/6
a. explain why 66666 * 7/6 = 66666/6 . 7 
answer: by the definition of division of fraction,
= 66666 * 7 * 1/6
= 66666 * 1/6 * 7 by associative property
= 66666 / 6 * 7

b. compute 66666 . 7/6
= 11111 * 7 = 77777
