================================
The square of a negation and negation of a square are not the same thing
-(2)^2 and -2^2 are not equal
================================

2.5
a. explain why (8.125)^2 = 8^2 . 125^2
answer:  (8 . 125) . (8 . 125)
= 8 . 8 . 125 . 125

evaluate 1/7^2
= 1/7 . 1/7 = 1/49

2.7
explain why (7224 : 12)^2 = 7224^2 : 12^2
because its just 7224 : 12 . 7224 : 12
= 7224 . 7224 : 12 . 12
= 7224^2 : 12^2

2.8

no it is not equal

2.9
a. using the picture at the right explain why 8^2 = 7^2 + 2(7) + 1
b. explain why 901^2 = 900^2 + 2(900) + 1
c. what is 901^2?

a. the 7^2 is the bottom left 7x7 blocks
the 2(7) is the top and right blocks
and the 1 is the top right
therefore the sum of all of those is a perfect 8x8 blocks

b. following the previous one,
if we have 901 total blocks,
the bottom left is 900 blocks wide, top and right is both 900 and the top right remaining is only 1

c. 8100000 + 1800 + 1
= 810018001


2.11
evaluate the following expression
a. 8 + 6 (3-8)^2

= 5(11) - 36
= 55 - 36
= 19

c. 92 - 45 / (3 . 5) - 5^2
= 92 - 45 / 15 - 5^2
= 92 - 45 / 15 - 25
= 92 - 3 - 25
= 92 - 28
= 64

d. 8(6^2 - 3(11)) / 8 + 3
= 8(36 - 33) / 8 + 3
= 8(3) / 8 + 3
= 24 / 8 + 3
= 3 + 3
= 6

e. (7+5)^2 - 7^2 - 5^2
= 12^2 - 7^2 - 5^2

= (48/4)^2
= 12^2 =144

d. 101^2
= (100+1)^2 = (100 + 1) . (100 . 1)
= 10000 + 2(100) + 1
= 10000 + 200 + 1
= 10201

e. what is the expression x^2 + 2x - 6
when x = -3?

(-3)^2 + 2(-3) - 6
= 9 - 6 - 6
= -3

(-4)^2 (-4-2)
= 16 (-6)
= -96


2.1.5
log base 2 of 500
= around 8 times
4 times

2.16
whats the perfect square closest to 5000?
70^2 = 4900
71^2 = (70+1)^2 = (70 + 1) (70 + 1) = 4900 + 2(70) + 1 = 4900 + 140 + 1 = 5041
therefore 5041 is closest

2.1.7

answer
closest approx perfect square
43^2 = (42+1)^2 = (42+1) (42+1)  = 

2.1.8
how many positive integers less than 500 are perfect squares?
20^2 = 400
22^2 = (21 + 1) (21 + 1) = 21*21 + 2.21 + 1 = 441 + 42 + 1 484

2.19
how many perfect squares are between 1000 and 2000?
30^2 = 900
31^2 = 900 + 2(30) + 1 = 961
32^2 = 1024

find the upper limit
44^2 = 1936
therefore the total is 32 - 44 = 13

= (2^13 . 2^3) . (5^13)
= 2^3 . (2.5)^13
= 2^3 . 10^13
= 8 . 10^13
total digits = 1 + 13 = 14

2.2.9
which of the numbers 2^100, 3^75, and 5^50 is the largest?
answer:

2^100 -> (2^4)^25 = 16^25
3^75 -> (3^3)^25 = 27^25
5^50 -> (5^2)^25 = 25^25

therefore 3^75 is the largest

2.2.10
when 10^93 - 93 is expressed as a single number, what is the sum of digits?

hint: what are the digits of the umber
hint: simplify the problem. what if we replaced with 10^93 with just 10^3? 10^4? 10^5?

answer
10^93 -> 93 digits
93 -> 2 digits

10^2 - 93 = 100 - 93 = 7 -> 1 digit
10^3 - 93 = 1000 - 93 =  907 -> 3 digit
10^4 - 93 = 10000 - 93 = 9907 -> 4 digit
10^5 - 93 = 100000 - 93 = 99907 -> 5 digit

last two digits are always 9 and 7
rest of digits are all nines
the number of nines is 9-2

from the pattern I guess 10^93 - 93 = 93 digits
number of nines for 10^93 = 93-2 = 91
sum of last 2 ditgits = 7
total sum  = number of nines * 9 + sum of last 2 digits
= 91 . 9 + 7
= (90+1).9 + 7
= 810+9+7
= 826


2.2.11
whihc of the numbers have   the greatest value?

2^3^4, 2^4^3, 3^4^2, 4^3^2, 4^2^3
answer:
lets compute one by one
2^3^4 -> 2^81
2^4^3 -> 2^64
3^4^2 -> 3^16
4^3^2 -> 4^9 -> (2^2)^9 -> 2^18
4^2^3 -> 4^8 -> (2^2)^8 -> 2^16

seems like the 1st one 2^3^4 has the most exponent
rewrite
3^16 = (3^2)^8 = 9^8
2^81 = 2^80 . 2^1 = (2^10)^8 . 2^1 = 1024^8 . 2^1
therefore 2^81 is the largest value

Higher Exponents

let a be any number and let n be a positive integer
the power of a^n, pronounced a to the n, is defined by

c. let a be nonzero number and let n be a positive integer. how are a^-n and (a^-1)^n related?

answer:
a. they are equal. (2^-1)^3 = 2^-1.3 = 2^-3 by power of powers
b. they are equal. (2^-1)^n = 2^-1.n = 2^-n
c. they are equal. (a^-1)^n = a^-1.n = a^-n

a. express each of 4^16, (-2)^34 and 16^8 as a power of 2
b. express each of (1/8)^-11 and (2^-4)^-8 as a power of 2
c. which of the following five number is the largest?
(1/8)^-11
4^16
 (-2)^34
 16^8
 (2^-4)^8 

 anwwer:
 a. 4^16 = (2^2)^16 = = 2^32
 (-2)^34 = 2^34
 16^8 - (2^4)^8 = 2^32

 b. (1/8)^-11 = 1/(1/8)^11 = 1 / 1/8^11 = 1 . 8^11 = (2^3)^11 = 2^33
 (2^-4)^-8 = 2^32

 c. therefore the largest is (-2)^34

 ==============

 let a be nonzero and let n be positive integer
 1/a^-n = a^n


==============

power of reciprocal
(1/a)^-n = a^n

==============

product of powers (same base) : a^m x a^n = a^m+n
product of powers (same exponent) a^n x b^n = (ab)^n

quotient of powers (same base) = a^m/a^n = a^m-n
quotient of powers (same exponent) = if b is nonzero then
a^n/b^n = (a/b)^n

pwoer of negation
(-a)^n = a^n if odd
(-a)^n = -a^n if even

power of power: (a^m)n = a^m.n
power of reciprocal = (1/a)^n = 1/a^n

negation in exponent = a^-n = 1^a^n
1/a^-n = a^n

when the expression 8^10 . 5^22 is mutiplied out, how many digits does the number have?

hint: zeroes at the end of a number - what number does that
make you think about multiplying by?

hint: how can you get 10s in the product?

answer:
lets try converting to same xponent
8^10 = 8^10 = (2^3)^10  = 2^30
2^30 . 5^22

we can form 22 (2 x 5) pairs with 2^8 leftover
= 2^22 . 5^22
= (2 . 5)^22 = 10^22

2^8 . 2^22 . 5^22
= 2^8 . 10^22
= 256 . 10^22
so total digits = 22 + 3 = 25

susbtitute back

(2^x)(30^3) = 120^3
2^x = 120^3 / 30^3
2^x = 4^3
2^x = (2^2)^3
2^x = 2^6
therefore x = 6

first 2 we know from previous
(a+b)(a+b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, we can substitute
= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 (a+b) 
= (a^2 . a) + (2ab . a) + (b^2 . a) + (a^2 . b) + (2ab . b) + (b^2 . b)
= a^3 + 2a^2b + b^2a + a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3

hint: distributive propert work with sums of three numbers just like it does with
sum of two number w(x+y+z) = wx + wy + wz

answer:
(a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)
= a(a^2 + ab + b^2) + -b(a^2 + ab + b^2)
= a^3 + a^2b + ab^2 + -ba^2 - ab^2 -b^3
= a^3 + a^2b - a^2b + ab^2 - ab^2 -b^3
= a^3 - b^3

c. show that (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = a^3 + b^3
= a(a^2 - ab + b^2) + b(a^2 - ab + b^2)
= a^3 - a^2b + ab^2 + ba^2 - ab^2 + b^3
= a^3 - a^2b + a^ab + ab^2 - ab^2 + b^3
= a^3 + b^3

what integer n has the property that
5^96 is greater than n^72 and 5^96 is less than (n+1)^72?

hint: can the numbers in the prbolem be written with the same xponent?
answer:
we need to find n such that

5^96 > n^72 and 5^96 < (n+1)^72

write in the same exponent
greatest common factor of 96 and 72 is 24, i think
(5^4)24 > (n^3)24
625^24 > (n^3)24
the n that satisfies this one is 8 whic his 8^3 = 512

test the other side with n=8
5^96 < (n+1)^72
(5^4)24 < (9^3)^24
625^24 < 729 threfore n=8 satisfies this
