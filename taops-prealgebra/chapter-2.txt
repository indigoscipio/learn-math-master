Squaring
let a be a number. the square of a, written a^2, is equal to a . a

problem 2.1
simplify 180 - 5 . 2^2
= 180 - 5 . 2 . 2
= 180 - 20
= 160

problem 2.2
what is the value of (2x + 5)^2
when x = 3?
answer: (2 . 3 + 5) = 6 + 5^2 = 30^2 = 900

2.3
a. evaluate -(12)^2
answer: - 12 . - 12
= 144
b. how are -(a)^2 and a^2 related?
answer: they are always positive result
every square is always nonnegative

2.4
a. what is -2^2
answer: 4
b. the expression -2^2 is the negation of the square of 2. what does -2^2 equal?
answer: 4
c. give x = -2, find hint value of 2x^2 + 3x + 4
= 2 . -2^2 + 3(-2) + 4
= 2 . 4 - 6 + 4
= 8 - 6 + 4
=6

================================
The square of a negation and negation of a square are not the same thing
-(2)^2 and -2^2 are not equal
================================

2.5
a. explain why (8.125)^2 = 8^2 . 125^2
answer:  (8 . 125) . (8 . 125)
= 8 . 8 . 125 . 125
and by the definition of square, a . a is equal to a^2
= 8^2 . 125^2
b. how doees part a help us compute 8^2 . 125^2 quickly?
answer: 8 . 125 = 1000 * 1000 = 1000000

==================
square of a product:
(ab)^2 = a^2 . b^2

==================

2.6
evaluate 1/7^2
= 1/7 . 1/7 = 1/49

2.7
explain why (7224 : 12)^2 = 7224^2 : 12^2
because its just 7224 : 12 . 7224 : 12
= 7224 . 7224 : 12 . 12
= 7224^2 : 12^2

2.8
a. what is the value of (5+6)^2
answer: 11^2 = 121
b. what is the value of 5^2 + 6^2
= 25 + 36 = 61
c. is (5+6)^2 equal to 5^2 + 6^2?
no it is not equal

2.9
a. using the picture at the right explain why 8^2 = 7^2 + 2(7) + 1
b. explain why 901^2 = 900^2 + 2(900) + 1
c. what is 901^2?

a. the 7^2 is the bottom left 7x7 blocks
the 2(7) is the top and right blocks
and the 1 is the top right
therefore the sum of all of those is a perfect 8x8 blocks

b. following the previous one,
if we have 901 total blocks,
the bottom left is 900 blocks wide, top and right is both 900 and the top right remaining is only 1

c. 8100000 + 1800 + 1
= 810018001


2.11
evaluate the following expression
a. 8 + 6 (3-8)^2
= 8 + 6 . (-5)^2
= 8 + 6 . 25
= 158

b. 5(3 + 4.2) - 6^2
= 5(3 + 8) - 36
= 5(11) - 36
= 55 - 36
= 19

c. 92 - 45 / (3 . 5) - 5^2
= 92 - 45 / 15 - 5^2
= 92 - 45 / 15 - 25
= 92 - 3 - 25
= 92 - 28
= 64

d. 8(6^2 - 3(11)) / 8 + 3
= 8(36 - 33) / 8 + 3
= 8(3) / 8 + 3
= 24 / 8 + 3
= 3 + 3
= 6

e. (7+5)^2 - 7^2 - 5^2
= 12^2 - 7^2 - 5^2
= 144 - 49 - 25
= 70

f.
25^2 . 16^2
= (25 . 16)^2
= 400^2 = 160000

c. 480^2 / 40^2
= (480/40)^2
= (48/4)^2
= 12^2 =144

d. 101^2
= (100+1)^2 = (100 + 1) . (100 . 1)
= 10000 + 2(100) + 1
= 10000 + 200 + 1
= 10201

e. what is the expression x^2 + 2x - 6
when x = -3?

(-3)^2 + 2(-3) - 6
= 9 - 6 - 6
= -3

2.14
evaluate x^2(x-t) 
if x = -4 and t = 2

(-4)^2 (-4-2)
= 16 (-6)
= -96


2.1.5
log base 2 of 500
= around 8 times
4 times

2.16
whats the perfect square closest to 5000?
70^2 = 4900
71^2 = (70+1)^2 = (70 + 1) (70 + 1) = 4900 + 2(70) + 1 = 4900 + 140 + 1 = 5041
therefore 5041 is closest

2.1.7
what year in the 19th century (yr 1801 - 1900) was a perfect square?
answer
closest approx perfect square
43^2 = (42+1)^2 = (42+1) (42+1)  =
