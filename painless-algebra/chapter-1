Commutative, associative, distributive

Commutative -> the order of operation does not matter.
you can switch a x b = b x a but only addition and multiplication has this property
a/b and a-b does not have this because the order does matter

Associative -> the way you group numbers (witout changing their order) doens't change the result
a/b and a-b does not have this propertyt because the groupoing matters

distributive -> when multipliying a monomial expression with a binomial, the answer is the monomial times the first term plus the 2nd term

why does 0 included in whole number? I wonder why.
