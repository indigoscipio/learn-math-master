solve the following systems of equation using addition
1. x - y = 4
x + y = 8
2x = 12
x = 6

x + y = 8
6 + y = 8
y = 2

2. 3x + y = 0
-3x + y = -6
2y = -6
y = -3

3x - 3 = 0
3x = 3
x = 1

3. 2x + 1/4y = -1
x - 1/4y = -2
3x = -3
x = -1

-1 - 1/4y = -2
-1/4y = -1
y = 4

solve these system of equations using subtration
1. 3x - 2y = 7
6x - 2y = 4

-3x = 3
x = -1

3(-1) - 2y = 7
-3 - 2y = 7
-2y = 10
y = -5


2. 1/2x + 2y = 3
1/2x - 5y = 10
7y = -7
y = -1

1/2x + 2(-1) = 3
1/2x - 2 = 3
1/2x = 5
x = 10

3. 3x + 6y = 9
2x + 6y = 8

x = 1
3(1) + 6y = 9
6y = 6
y = 1

4. 7x - 2/3y = 12
x - 2/3y = 0

6x = 12
x = 2

2 - 2/3y = 0
-2/3y = -2
y = -2 * -3/2
y = 6/2
y = 3

For each of the following, multiply the first
 equation by the coefficient of the x term of the
 second equation. Multiply the second equation
 by the coefficient of the x term of the first
 equation. Next, add or subtract to solve the
 system of equations.

 1. 3x + 2y = 12
 x - y = 10

 2. 2x - y = 3
 -4x + y = 6

 3. -5x + y = 8
 -2x + 2y = 4

 4. 1/2x - 2y = 6
 4x + 2y = 12
