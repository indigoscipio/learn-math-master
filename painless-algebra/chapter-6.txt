For each of the following, multiply the first
equation by the coefficient of the x term of the
second equation. Multiply the second equation
by the coefficient of the x term of the first
equation. Next, add or subtract to solve the
system of equations.

 1. 3x + 2y = 12
 x - y = 10

1(3x + 2y = 12)
3(x-y = 10)

3x + 2y = 12
3x - 3y = 30
5y = -18
y = -18/5

x + 18/5 = 10
x = 10 - 18/5
x = 50/5 - 18/5
x = 32/5

 2. 2x - y = 3
 -4x + y = 6

 -4(2x - y = 3)
 2( -4x + y = 6)

 -8x + 4y = -12

 2y = -24
 y = -12

 2x + 12 = 3
 2x = 3 - 12
 2x = -9
 x = -9/2

 3. -5x + y = 8
 -2x + 2y = 4

 -2(-5x + y = 8)
 -5(-2x + 2y = 4)

10x - 2y = -16
10x - 10y = -20
8y = 4
y = 1/2

-2x + 2(1/2) = 4
