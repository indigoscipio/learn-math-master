  Solve each of the following square root prob
lems by rewriting the radical expression as
 two separate expressions.

 1. sqrt((16)(9)) = 4.3 = 12
 2. sqrt((64)(100)) = 8 . 10 = 80
 3. sqrt(25y^2) = 5 . y = 5y
 4. sqrt((4)(11)) = 2 . sqrt(11)
 5. sqrt(9y) = 3 . sqrt(y)

  In each case, simplify the radical expressions
 by placing them under the same radical sign.
 1. (sqrt3)(sqrt3) = sqrt(3.3) = sqrt(9) = 3
 2. (sqrt8)(sqrt2) = sqrt(8.2) = sqrt(16) = 4
 3. (sqrt12)(sqrt3) = sqrt(12.3) = sqrt(36) = 6
 4. (sqrtx)(sqrtx) = sqrt(x.x) = sqrt(x^2) = x
 5. (sqrtx^3)(sqrtx) = sqrt(x^3.x) = sqrt(x^4) = x^2

  Simplify the following radical expressions by
 factoring.
 1. sqrt(20) = sqrt(2.2.5) = 2sqrt(5)
 2. sqrt(8) = sqrt(2.2.2) = 2sqrt(2)
 3. sqrt(27) = sqrt(3.3.3) = 3sqrt(3)
 4. sqrt(24) = sqrt(2.2.6) = 2sqrt(6)
 5. sqrt(32) = sqrt(2.2.8) = 2sqrt(8) = 4sqrt(2)
 6. sqrt(125) = sqrt(5.5.5) = 5sqrt(5)
