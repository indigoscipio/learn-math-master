1. x^2 - 2x = 0
x(x-2) = 0

x = 0
x - 2 = 0
x = 2

so x either 0 or 2

2. x^2 + 4x = 0
x(x + 4) = 0
x = 0
x+4 = 0
x = -4

so x either 0 or -4

3. 2x^2 - 6x = 0
x(2x - 6) = 0
x = 0
2x-6 = 0
2x = 6
x = 3

so x either 0 or 3

4. 1/2x^2 + 2x = 0
x(1/2x + 2) = 0
x = 0
1/2x + 2 = 0
1/2x = -2
x = -4

so x either 0 or -4
