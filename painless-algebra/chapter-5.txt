Change each of the following equations to
 slope-intercept form, and find the slope
1. 5x-y + 2 = 0
-y = -2 -5x
-y = -5x - 2
y = 5x + 2
slope = 5

2. 4x + 2y = 0
2y = -4x
y = -2x
slope = -2

3. x + y = 1
y = 1 - x
slope = -1

4. -6 = 6x + 6y
-6 - 6x = 6y
-1 -x = y
y = -1 - x
slope = -1

1. (5,0), (0,2) = 2-0/0-5 = 2/-5
2. (0,0), (5,5) = 5-0/5-0 = 5/5 = 1
3. (5,0), (0,2) = 2-0 / 0-5 = 2/-5
4. (5,0), (0,2) = 2-0 / 0-5 = 2/-5

a. find the equation of each line
1. slope 3 and point (4,-4)
y = mx + b
y = 3x + b
-4 = 3.4 + b
-4 = 12 + b
b = -16

substitute back
y = 3x - 16

2. slope 1/4 and point (0,0)
y = mx + b
y = 1/4x + b

substitute the points
0 = 1/4 * 0 + b
b = 0

substitute b back into the formula
y = 1/4x + 0
y = 1/4x

3. slope -1 and point (5,2)
y = mx + b
y = -1x + b
2 = -1(5) + b
2 = -5 + b
b = 7

y = -1x + 7

4. (1,1) and (3,0)
slope = 0-1 / 3-1 = -1/2

y = mx + b
y = -1/2x + b
1 = -1/2 + b
1 + 1/2 = b
b = 3/2

substitute b back
y = -1/2x + 3/2

5. (0,4) and (2,0)
slope = 0-4 / 2-0 = -4/2 = -2

y = mx + b
y = 

6. (-1,6) and (5,-2)
